<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> little work aims to be the very least of all;—not
in <i>size</i>, but in the humility of its contents. It
aims at the superlative degree of littleness; and in
this point seeks to resemble the least watch ever
made—the least picture ever painted—the tiniest
flower that ever grew. It desires to be among
books as the humming-bird among birds.</p>

<p>As soon as a child’s mind is <i>capable</i> of receiving
<i>systematic</i> instruction, this humble work attempts
to convey it.</p>

<p>From a very early period a pious mother will, by
<i>casual</i> remarks, endeavor to lead her child to the
knowledge of his Creator and Redeemer; and in
due time she will impart <i>systematic</i> instruction. It
may be at <i>three</i> years of age—it may <i>not</i> be till
<i>five</i>—that the child is prepared to listen to these
little lessons. But—sooner or later—he will give
evidence of his immortality by willingly hearkening
to discourse concerning the <span class="smcap">Invisible</span>—the <span class="smcap">Eternal</span>—the
<span class="smcap">Infinite</span>.</p>

<p>The simplicity of the language may seem unworthy
of the sublimity of the subject treated of in these
pages; and some may smile at the contrast;—but
the little one will not smile—except with joy to hear
of his Heavenly Father, and of his Incarnate Redeemer;
for the merry inmates of the nursery are
capable of tasting higher pleasures than toys and
dainties can afford.</p>

<h2>THE PEEP OF DAY.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>LESSON I.<br />
<small>OF THE BODY.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Children</span>:—You have seen the sun in the
sky. Who put the sun in the sky?—God.</p>

<p>Can you reach up so high?—No.</p>

<p>Who holds up the sun that it does not fall?—It is
God. God lives in heaven; heaven is much higher
than the sun.</p>

<p>Can you see God?—No. Yet He can see you,
for God sees everything.</p>

<p>God made everything at first, and God takes care
of everything. God made you, my little child, and
God takes care of you always.</p>

<p>You have a little body; from your head down to
your feet, I call your body.</p>

<p>Put your hand before your mouth. What do
you feel coming out of your mouth? It is your
breath. You breathe every moment. When you
are asleep, you breathe. You cannot help breathing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
But who gives you breath? God does everything.
God gave you this little body, and he makes
it live, and move, and breathe. There are bones in
your body. God has made them strong and hard.
There are some bones for your arms, and some
bones for your legs. There is a bone for your back,
and more bones for you sides.</p>

<p>God has covered your bones with flesh. Your
flesh is soft and warm. In your flesh there is blood.
God has put skin outside, and it covers your flesh
and blood like a coat. Now all these things, the
bones, and flesh, and blood, and skin, are called
your body. How kind of God it was to give you
a body. I hope that your body will not get hurt.</p>

<p>Will your bones break?—Yes, they would, if you
were to fall down from a high place, or if a cart
were to go over them.</p>

<p>If you were to be very sick, your flesh would
waste away, and you would have scarcely anything
left but skin and bones.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a child who had been sick a
very long while? I have seen a sick baby. It had
not round cheeks like yours, and a fat arm like
this. The baby’s flesh was almost gone, and its
little bones were only covered with skin. God has
kept you strong and well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>How easy it would be to hurt your poor little
body!</p>

<p>If it were to fall into the fire, it would be burned
up. If hot water were thrown upon it, it would be
scalded. If it were to fall into deep water, and not
be taken out very soon, it would be drowned. If
a great knife were run through your body, the
blood would come out. If a great box were to fall
on your head, your head would be crushed. If you
were to fall out of the window, your neck would be
broken. If you were not to eat some food for a
few days, your little body would be very sick, your
breath would stop, and you would grow cold, and
you would soon be dead.</p>

<p>You see that you have a very weak little body.</p>

<p>Can you keep your own body from being sick,
and from getting hurt?</p>

<p>You should try not to hurt yourself, but God
only can keep your body from all harm, from fire
and water, from wounds and bruises, and all kinds
of sickness. Kneel down and say to God, “Pray
keep my poor little body from getting hurt.” God
will hear you, and go on taking care of you.</p>

<h2>LESSON II.<br />
<small>OF A MOTHER’S CARE.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> told you about your little body. Was your
body always as big as it is now?—No. Once it was
very small indeed.</p>

<p>What were you called when your body was very
small?—A baby.</p>

<p>Now you can take a little care of yourself, but
then you could take no care at all. Can babies
walk, or talk, or feed themselves, or dress themselves?—No.</p>

<p>But God sent you a person who took great care
of you when you were a baby.</p>

<p>Who was it?—Your dear mother; she took care
of you then. She nursed you in her arms, and fed
you, and took you out in the air, and washed you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and dressed you. Do you love your mother?—Yes.</p>

<p>I know you do. But who gave you a mother?
It was God who sent you to a kind mother.</p>

<p>A little while ago there was no such little creature
as you. Then God made your little body, and he
sent you to your mother, who loved you as soon
as she saw you. It was God who made your
mother love you so much, and made her so kind to
you.</p>

<p>Your kind mother dressed your poor little body
in neat clothes, and laid you in a cradle. When
you cried she gave you food, and hushed you to
sleep in her arms. She showed you pretty things
to make you smile. She held you up, and showed
you how to move your feet. She taught you to
speak, and she often kissed you, and called you
sweet names.</p>

<p>Is your mother kind to you still?—Yes, she is,
though she is sometimes angry. But she wishes to
make you good: that is why she is sometimes angry.</p>

<p>Your mother has sent you to this nice school,
and she gives you supper when you go home. I
know she will be kind to you as long as she lives.</p>

<p>But remember who gave you this mother. God
sent you to a dear mother, instead of putting you

<p>Can your mother keep you alive?—No.</p>

<p>God thinks of you every moment. If he were

<p>Do you ever thank your mother for her kindness?—Yes.
You often say, “Thank you,” and
sometimes you put your arms around her neck,
and say, “I do love you so much, dear mother!”
Will you not thank God who gave you a mother,
and who keeps you alive? You should kneel down
when you speak to God; then you should say, “O
God, how good you have been to me! I thank you,
and love you.”</p>

<p>Would God hear your little thanks?—Yes, God
would hear and be pleased.</p>

<h2>LESSON III.<br />
<small>OF THE SOUL.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Has</span> God been kind to dogs? Has he given them
bodies?—Yes.</p>

<p>Have they bones, and flesh, and blood, and skin?—Yes.</p>

<p>The dog has a body as well as you. Is the dog’s
body like yours?—No.</p>

<p>How many legs have you?—Two.</p>

<p>How many legs has the dog?—Four.</p>

<p>Have you got arms?—Yes, two.</p>

<p>Has the dog got arms?—No, it has no arms, nor
hands. But the dog has legs instead. Your skin
is smooth, but the dog is covered with hair.</p>

<p>Is the cat’s body like yours?—No; it is covered
with fur.</p>

<p>Is a chicken’s body like yours? How many legs
has the chicken?—Two.</p>

<p>And so have you. But are its legs like yours?—No;
the chicken has very thin, dark legs, and it has
claws instead of feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Have you feathers on your skin? Have you
wings? Is your mouth like a chicken’s beak? Has
the chicken any teeth?—No; the chicken’s body is
not at all like yours. Yet the chicken has a body—for
it has flesh, and bones, and blood, and skin.</p>

<p>Has a fly got a body?—Yes, it has a black body,
and six black legs, and two wings like glass. Its
body is not at all like yours.</p>

<p>Who gave bodies to dogs, horses, chickens, and
flies? Who keeps them alive?</p>

<p>God thinks of all these creatures every moment.</p>

<p>Can a dog thank God. No; dogs and horses,
sheep and cows, cannot thank God.</p>

<p>Why can not they thank God? Is is because
they cannot talk?</p>

<p>That is not the reason.</p>

<p>The reason is, they cannot think of God. They
never heard of God. They cannot understand about
God.</p>

<p>Why not?—Because they have no <i>souls</i>, or spirits,
like yours.</p>

<p>Have you got a soul?—Yes, in your body there
is a soul which will never die. Your soul can
think of God.</p>

<p>When God made your body, he put your soul
inside. Are you glad of that? When God made
the dogs, he put no soul like yours inside their
bodies, and they cannot think of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Can I see your soul?—No; I cannot see it. No
one can see it but God. He knows what you are
thinking of now.</p>

<p>Which is the best, your soul or your body?—Your
soul is a great deal the best. Why is your
soul the best?—Your body can die, but your soul
cannot die.</p>

<p>Shall I tell you what your body is made of?—Of
dust. God made the dust into flesh and blood.</p>

<p>What is your soul made of?—Your soul, or spirit,
is made of the breath of God.</p>

<p>That little dog will die some day. Its body will
be thrown away. The dog will be quite gone when
its body is dead. But when your body dies, your
soul will be alive, and you will not be quite gone.</p>

<p>Where would you be put if you were dead?—Your
body would be put in a hole in the ground,
but your soul would not be in the hole. Even a
baby has a soul, or spirit.</p>

<p>One day as I was walking in the streets, I saw a
man carrying a box. Some people were walking
behind, crying. There was a dead baby in the box.
Was the soul of the baby in the box?—No; its soul
was gone up to God.</p>

<p>Will you not thank God for giving you a spirit?
Will you not ask Him to take your spirit to live
with him when your body dies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Say to God, “Pray, take my spirit to live with
Thee when my body dies and turns into dust.”</p>

<h2>LESSON IV.<br />
<small>OF THE GOOD ANGELS.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> know that God lives in heaven. He has no
body, for he is a spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Does he live in heaven alone?—No; angels stand
all round his throne.</p>

<p>What are angels?</p>

<p>Angels are spirits. They are bright like the sun,
but they are not so bright as God, for he is brighter
than the sun. The angels are always looking at
God, and it is God that makes them shine so bright.</p>

<p>They sing sweet songs about God. They say,
“How good God is! how wise! how great!”</p>

<p>There is no night in heaven, for the angels are
never tired of singing, and they never wish to sleep.
They are never sick, and they will never die.</p>

<p>They never weep; there are no tears upon their
cheeks, but sweet smiles, for angels are always happy.</p>

<p>If the angels were naughty, they would be unhappy.
Naughtiness always makes people unhappy.
The angels are quite good. They love
God very much, and mind all he says.</p>

<p>They have wings, and can fly very quickly. God
sends them down here to take care of us. As soon
as God tells an angel to go, he begins to fly. They
are very strong, and can keep us from harm.</p>

<p>Should you like the angels to be near you at
night? Do you know this pretty verse or hymn?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I lay my body down to sleep,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let angels guard my head,</span></div>

<p>You must ask God to send the angels, for they
never go, except when God sends them.</p>

<p>God is their Father. They have not two fathers,
as you have. The angels are the children of God,
and live in God’s house in heaven. When you
mind what your father tells you, then you are like
the angels who mind God.</p>

<p>The angels love us very much. They wish us to
grow good, and to come to live with them in
heaven. When a child is sorry for its naughtiness,
and prays to God to forgive it, the angels are very
much pleased.</p>

<p>When a little child who loves God falls sick, and
is going to die, God says to the angels, “Go and
fetch that little child’s soul up to heaven.” Then
the angels fly down, the little darling shuts its eyes,
it lays its head on its mothers bosom, its breath
stops;—the child is dead. Where is its soul? The
angels are carrying it up to heaven.</p>

<p>How happy the child is now! Its pain is over;
it is grown quite good; it is bright like an angel.
It holds a harp in its hand, and begins to sing a
sweet song of praise to God. Its little body is put
into a grave, and turns into dust. One day God
will make its body alive again.</p>

<p>Dear children, will you pray to God to send his
angels to fetch your souls when you die?</p>

<h2>LESSON V.<br />
<small>OF THE WICKED ANGELS.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> did God begin to live in heaven? God always
lived in heaven.</p>

<p>Once there was no such little child as you, but
there always was God.</p>

<p>Once there was no sun, but there always was
God.</p>

<p>Once there were no angels, but there always was
God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>No one made God; God was the first of all things,
and God made everything.</p>

<p>A very long while ago God made the angels.
How many angels did he make? No one could
tell how many. There were more than could be
counted. They were all good and happy.</p>

<p>But some of the angels grew bad. They left off
loving God, and grew proud, and disobedient.</p>

<p>Would God let them stay in heaven after they
were bad? No; he cast them out, and put them in
chains and darkness.</p>

<p>One of these bad angels was called Satan. He
is the chief, or prince of the bad angels. He is
called the devil.</p>

<p>The devil is very wicked, and hates God. He
can never go back to heaven again, but he comes
here where we live, and he brings the other devils
with him.</p>

<p>We cannot see Satan, because he is a spirit, but
he is always walking about, and trying to make
people naughty.</p>

<p>Satan loves mischief; he does not wish to be
good. It pleases Satan to see people in pain and in
tears; but it pleases him best to see them naughty,
because then he thinks that they will come and live
with him in his dark place. He wishes that there
should be a great many people in hell, so he tries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to make us do wicked things, and keep us from
praying to God.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how very bad Satan is. He
is very cruel, for he likes to give pain. He is a
liar and teaches people to tell lies. He is proud,
and wishes people to mind him more than God.
He is envious, and cannot bear to see people happy.</p>

<p>The devil hopes very much that you will come
and live with him when you die. He knows that
if you are bad like him, you will live with him.
So he tries to make you like himself. When you
are in a passion, you are like the devil. When you
say, “I don’t care,” you are like the devil. When
you think yourself good, you are proud like the
devil.</p>

<p>Can God keep you from minding the devil? Yes;
he can: for God is a great deal stronger than Satan.
Besides this, God is always near you, for God is
everywhere. Now Satan cannot be everywhere at
the same time. It is true that Satan has a great
many angels who go where he tells them; and that
Satan and his angels come near you very often.
But God is always with you; he is before you and
behind you, and on every side of you; he is about
your bed when you sleep, and about your path when
you walk. Therefore you need not be afraid of
Satan; only ask God to help you, and he will do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Satan is much stronger than you are; but God is
stronger than all. If anybody were to come to hurt
you when you were alone, you would be frightened;
but if you saw your father coming you would run
to him, and you would not be frightened any more.
Now God is our father; he can keep Satan from
hurting you. Pray to him, and say, “O dear father,
keep me from being wicked like the devil, and from
going to hell.”</p>

is very beautiful. If we look up we see the blue
sky, if we look down we see the green grass. The
sky is like a curtain spread over our heads, the
grass like a carpet under our feet, and the bright
sun is like a candle to give us light. It was very
kind of God to make such a beautiful world, and
let us live in it.</p>

<p>God was in heaven, and all his bright angels
around him, when he began to make the world.
God’s Son was with him—for God always has a
Son, just like himself.</p>

<p>His Son’s name is Jesus Christ. He is as good
and as great as God his Father. The Father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the Son are God: they always lived together, and
they love each other exceedingly. The Father and
the Son are one God, and they made the world.</p>

<p>How did God make the world?—By speaking.
First of all, God made the light. God said, “Let
there be light,” and there was light. No one can
make things by speaking but God: God made
things of nothing. He only spoke, and the light
came.</p>

<p>Then God made the air. You cannot see the air,
but you can feel it. The air is everywhere. You
can sometimes hear the noise it makes, for you hear
the wind blow, and the wind is air.</p>

<p>Next God put some water up very high. The
clouds are full of water, and sometimes the water
comes down, and we call it rain.</p>

<p>God made a large deep place, and filled it with
water. God spoke to the water, and it rushed into
the deep place. God called this water the sea.</p>

<p>The sea is very large, and it is always moving up
and down, and tossing itself; but it cannot get out
of the large deep place in which God has put it;
for God said, “Stay there.”</p>

<p>When the wind blows hard, the sea makes a loud
noise, and roars.</p>

<p>God made some dry land for us to walk upon: we
call it ground. We could not walk upon the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
nor build houses on the sea: but the ground is hard,
and firm, and dry.</p>

<p>Now I have told you of five things that God
made:—</p>

<p>1. The light. 2. The air. 3. The clouds. 4. The
sea. 5. The dry land.</p>

<p>Let us praise God for making such a large and
beautiful world.</p>

<h2>LESSON VII.<br />
<small>THE WORLD.—PART II.<br />
<span class="smcap">Genesis</span> i. 11-19.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> God made the dry land, there was nothing
on it: it was bare. So God spake, and things grew
out of the ground.</p>

<p>Trees came out of it; they were covered with
green leaves of different shapes. Some were called
oak trees, and some were called elm trees, and some
beech trees. And some bore nice fruit, such as
plum trees, apple trees, orange trees and fig trees.</p>

<p>Vegetables grew out of the earth; potatoes and
beans, cabbages and lettuces: they are called vegetables.</p>

<p>Corn came out of it. Some corn is called wheat,
and some corn is called barley, and some is called
oats. The ears of corn bend down when they are
ripe, and look yellow like gold.</p>

<p>God made the soft green grass to spring up, and
flowers to grow among the grass: flowers of all
colors, and of the sweetest smell. The yellow buttercup,
the white lily, the blue violet, and the rose,
the most beautiful of all flowers.</p>

<p>I have told you of five sorts of things that grow
out of the earth:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Trees. 2. Vegetables. 3. Corn. 4. Grass. 5.
Flowers.</p>

<p>The world looked very beautiful when it was covered
with grass and trees. But only God and the
angels saw its beauty.</p>

<p>Afterward God placed the sun in the sky, and
bade it shine all day, and go from one end of the
world to the other. God made the moon to shine
at night, and he covered the sky with stars.</p>

<p>You never saw anything so bright as the sun. It
is very large indeed, only it looks small, because
it is a great way off. It cannot fall, for God holds
it up. God makes it move across the sky. Did
you ever hear this pretty verse about the sun?—</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The moon does not shine as brightly as the sun,
for God lets it be dark at night, that we may rest
and sleep soundly.</p>

<p>Who could count the stars?—No one but God.
He knows their names and their number too.
When we look at the moon and stars, let us think,
How great God is! Yet he cares for the little birds,
and loves little children.</p>

<h2>LESSON VIII.<br />
<small>THE WORLD.—PART III.<br />
<span class="smcap">Genesis</span> i. 20-25.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">God</span> had made a great many things, but none of
these things were alive. At last he made some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
living things. He spoke, and the water was filled
with fishes, more than could be counted.</p>

<p>Some were very small, and some were very large.
Have you heard of the great whale? It is a fish as
long as a church. Fishes are cold, and they have
no feet, and they cannot sing, nor speak.</p>

<p>God made some creatures, more beautiful than
fish, to fly about in the air. The birds:—they
perched upon the trees, and sang among the
branches.</p>

<p>Birds have wings, and are covered with feathers
of all colors. The robin has a red breast; the goldfinch
has some yellow feathers; and the jay some
blue ones: but the peacock is the most beautiful of
birds. It has a little tuft upon its head, and a long
train that sweeps behind; sometimes it spreads out
its feathers, and they look like a large fan. The
thrush, the blackbird and the linnet can sing
sweetly: but there is one bird that can sing more
sweetly still—it is the nightingale. At night, when
all the other birds have left off singing, the nightingale
may be heard in the woods.</p>

<p>Some birds swim upon the water; such as geese,
and ducks, and the beautiful swan, with its long
neck and its feathers like the snow.</p>

<p>Some birds are very tall. The ostrich is as tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
as a man. It cannot fly like other birds, but it can
run very fast indeed.</p>

<p>The eagle builds its nest in a very high place.
Its wings are very strong, and it can fly as high as
the clouds.</p>

<p>The gentlest of the birds is the dove. It cannot
sing, but it sits alone and moans softly, as if it were
sad.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you the names of all the birds, but
you can think of the names of some other kinds.</p>

<p>There is another sort of living creatures, called
insects. God made them come out of the earth,
and not out of the water, like fishes. Insects are
small, and creep upon the earth; such as ants. Some
insects can fly also; such as bees and butterflies.
The bee sucks the juice of flowers, and makes wax
and honey. How gay are the wings of the butterfly!
they are covered with little feathers, too
small to be seen.</p>

<p>All the insects were good and pretty when God
made them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/illus035.jpg" width="430" height="600" alt="Jesus and Jairus' daughter" />
<div class="caption">CHRIST RAISING TO LIFE THE LITTLE MAID.</div>
</div>

<p>At last God made the beasts. They came out of
the earth when God spoke. Beasts walk upon the
earth; the most of them have four legs. You know
the names of a great many sorts of beasts. Sheep
and cows, dogs and cats, are beasts. But there are
many other sorts besides: the squirrel that jumps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
from bough to bough, the rabbit that lives in a hole
underground, and the goat that climbs the high
hills; the stag with his beautiful horns, the lion with
his yellow hair, the tiger, whose skin is marked with
stripes. The elephant is the largest of beasts, the
lion is the strongest, the dog is the most sensible,
the stag is the most beautiful, but the lamb is the
gentlest. The dove is the gentlest of the birds, and
the lamb is the gentlest of the beasts.</p>

<p>Now God had filled the world with living creatures,
and they were all good; even lions and tigers
were good and harmless. I have told you of four
sorts of living creatures:</p>

<p>1. Fishes. 2. Birds. 3. Insects. 4. Beasts.</p>

<p>All these creatures have bodies, but they have
not souls like you. They can move and breathe.
God feeds them every day, and keeps them alive.
The Lord is good to them all.</p>

<h2>LESSON IX.<br />
<small>ADAM AND EVE.<br />
<span class="smcap">Genesis</span> i., 26, to the end of Chap. ii.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> I shall tell you of the last thing God made.</p>

<p>God took some of the dust of the ground, and
made the body of a man; then he breathed on it,
and gave it a soul; so the man could understand
about God. Adam was quite good like God. Adam
loved God very much.</p>

<p>God put him in a very pretty garden, full of trees
covered with fruit. This garden was called the
garden of Eden. God showed Adam all the beasts
and birds, and let Adam give them what names he
pleased. He said to Adam, I give you all the fishes,
and insects, and birds, and beasts; you are their
master. So Adam was king over all things on the
earth.</p>

<p>God said to Adam, You may eat of the fruit that
grows on the trees in the garden. Still God did
not let him be idle, but told him to take care of the
garden. You see how very kind God was to Adam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>But Adam had no friend to be with him; for the
beasts and birds could not talk to Adam. Then
God said he would make a woman, to be a friend
to Adam. So God made Adam fall fast asleep.
God took a piece of bone and flesh out of his side,
and made it into a woman. When Adam woke, he
saw her. He knew that she was made of his flesh and
bone, and he loved her very much. Her name was
“woman,” and afterwards her name was Eve.</p>

<p>You have heard of all the things God made. They
were all beautiful: and all the living things were
quite happy; there was no pain, and no sighing, and
no sin in all the world.</p>

<p>God had been six days in making the world.
And when he had finished it, he rested on the seventh
day, and made no more things.</p>

<p>The angels saw the world that God had made:
they were pleased, and sang a sweet song of praise
to God. Jesus Christ the Son of God was pleased,
for he loved Adam and Eve.</p>

<p>How did I know about the world being made?
It is written in the Bible, which is God’s own book.</p>

<p>Let us count over all the things that God made:</p>

<p>1. Light. 2. Air. 3. Clouds. 4. Sea. 5. Dry
land. 6. Things that grow out of the earth. 7.
Sun, moon, and stars. 8. Living creatures.</p>

<h2>LESSON X.<br />
<small>THE FIRST SIN.<br />
<span class="smcap">Genesis</span> iii.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Adam</span> and Eve were very happy in the garden of
Eden. They talked to each other, and walked together,
and they never quarreled, and they praised
God for all his kindness to them.</p>

<p>God used to talk with them sometimes. They
were pleased to hear his voice, for they were not
afraid of him.</p>

<p>There was one thing that God had told them not
to do. There was a tree in the middle of the garden.
Some beautiful fruit grew upon it; but God
said to Adam and Eve, You must not eat of the
fruit of that tree; for if you eat of it, you shall die.
Adam and Eve liked to obey God, and they did not
wish to eat of this fruit.</p>

<p>You know that the wicked angel, Satan, hates
God, and he hated Adam and Eve. He wished to
make them naughty, that they might go to hell and
be burned in his fire. So he thought he would ask
them to eat of that fruit. He went into the garden,
and looked like a serpent. He saw Eve alone near
the tree. He said to her, Why do you not eat of
this fruit?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Eve answered, No, I will not; we must not eat
of that fruit. If we do, God has said we shall die.
Then the serpent said, You shall not die; the fruit
will make you wise.</p>

<p>Eve looked at the fruit, and thought it seemed
nice and pretty, and she picked some and ate it;
and she gave some to Adam, and he ate it.</p>

<p>It was very wicked of them to eat this fruit.
Now they were grown naughty, and did not love
God.</p>

<p>Soon they heard God speaking in the garden;
then they were frightened, and they went and hid
themselves among the trees. But God saw them;
for he can see everywhere.</p>

<p>So God said, Adam, where art thou? Then
Adam and Eve came from under the trees.</p>

<p>God said to Adam, Have you eaten of the fruit
that I told you not eat? And Adam said, It was
this woman who asked me to eat some.</p>

<p>And God said to Eve, What is this that thou
hast done? And Eve said, The serpent asked me
to eat.</p>

<p>God was very angry with the serpent, and said
he should be punished forever and ever.</p>

<p>God said to Adam and Eve, You shall die. I
made your bodies of dust, and they will turn to
dust again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>God would not let them stay in the sweet garden.
He made them go out. He would not let
them come back. He told one of his bright angels
to stand before the gate with a sword of fire and to
keep Adam and Eve out of the garden.</p>

<h2>LESSON XI.<br />
<small>THE SON OF GOD.<br />
<span class="smcap">Genesis</span> iii. 14-15.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Are</span> you not very sorry to hear that Adam and Eve
were turned out of the garden?</p>

<p>It was not so pleasant outside of the garden. A
great many weeds and thistles grew outside; but
in the garden there were only pretty flowers and
sweet fruits.</p>

<p>Adam was forced to dig the ground till he was
hot and tired, for he could not always find fruit
upon the trees.</p>

<p>Now Adam felt pain in his body sometimes; and
his hair became gray, and at last he was quite old.</p>

<p>Eve was very often sick and weak, and tears ran
down her cheeks. Poor Adam and Eve! if you
had obeyed God you would have been happy forever.</p>

<p>Adam and Eve knew that they must die at last.
God gave them some little children; and Adam and
Eve knew that their children must die too. God
had told them that their bodies were made of dust,
and that they must turn to dust again.</p>

<p>But there was something more sad still. They
were grown wicked. They did not love praising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
God, as they once had done, but they liked doing
many naughty things. They were grown like
Satan; so Satan hoped that when their bodies were
put into the ground, their spirits would be with
him; for Satan knew that the wicked could not live
with God in heaven.</p>

<p>And they would have gone to hell, and all their
children too, had not God taken pity upon them.
God, who is very kind, had found out a way to save
them.</p>

<p>To his Son, a long, long while before, God had
said, Adam and Eve and all their children must go
to hell for their wickedness, unless you die instead
of them. My beloved Son, I will send you; you
shall have a body; you shall go and live in the
world, and you shall obey me, and you shall die
for Adam and his children.</p>

<p>The Son said to his Father, I will come: I will do
all that you desire me to do. It is my delight to
obey you.</p>

<p>So the Son promised that he would die for Adam
and Eve, and for their children.</p>

<p>How kind it was of the Father to spare his dear
Son, whom he loved so very much! How kind it
was of the Son to leave his throne of light, his
bright angels, and his dear Father, and to take a
body and to die!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>You know that we are some of Adam’s children’s
children. It was for us that Jesus came to die.
We are wicked, and we should go to hell, if Jesus
had not promised to die for us. We ought to love
the Father and the Son, because they had pity
on us.</p>

<p>Let us praise God with the angels, and say,—</p>

<p>“We thank thee, O Father, for thy tender love,
in giving up thine only Son.</p>

<p>“We thank thee, O Son, for thy tender love, in
coming down to bleed and die.”</p>

<p>The Father waited a long while before he sent his
Son down to be a man.</p>

<p>All the time the Son waited in heaven he thought
of what he promised to do; but he would not go
and be a man till his Father pleased to send him.</p>

<h2>LESSON XII.<br />
<small>THE VIRGIN MARY.<br />
<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, i. 26-55.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">God</span> told Adam and Eve that he would send his
Son down some day to die for them. But Adam
and Eve did not love God; for they were grown
wicked.</p>

<p>Could God make them good?</p>

<p>Yes; he could: for there is the Holy Spirit in
heaven, and the Holy Spirit could come into them
and make them good.</p>

<p>You know, my little children, we are wicked,
and God can make us good with his Holy Spirit. If
God puts his Holy Spirit in us, we shall not go to
hell, and live with Satan.</p>

<p>I hope you will ask God to give you his Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Spirit. Say to God, O give me thy Holy Spirit, to
make me good!</p>

<p>Adam had a great many children and grandchildren,
and they had more children; at last the
world was full of people—more people than you
could count.</p>

<p>After Adam and Eve had been dead a long while,
and when the world was full of people, God said to
his Son, Now, my beloved Son, go down into the
world.</p>

<p>But God chose that his Son should be a little baby
at first—because everybody is a little baby at first.</p>

<p>God sent his Son to be the baby of a poor
woman. This woman’s name was Mary. Mary
had no little children. She was a good woman and
loved God. God’s Holy Spirit was in her, and
made her meek and gentle.</p>

<p>One day an angel came to her. When Mary
saw the bright angel, she was frightened: but the
angel said, “Fear not, Mary; God loves you. He
will send you a baby, that shall be the Son of God.
You shall call his name Jesus. He will come to
save people from Satan.”</p>

<p>Mary was much surprised at what the angel said.
She thought she was not good enough to have such
a baby as the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>When the angel was gone back to heaven, Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
sang a sweet song of praise to God for his goodness.</p>

<p>Mary said, My soul praises God, and my spirit is
glad because of my Saviour.</p>

<p>Mary called her baby her Saviour, for she knew
that he would save her from hell.</p>

<h2>LESSON XIII.<br />
<small>THE BIRTH OF JESUS.<br />
<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, ii. 1-7.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Mary</span> had a husband called Joseph. He was a
good man, and very kind to Mary.</p>

<p>Now before Mary’s baby was born, a great king
said that everybody must have their names written
down. So Mary and Joseph left their house, and
went a great way off. At last they came to a town
called Bethlehem.</p>

<p>It was night. Where could they sleep? They
went to an inn, and said, Do let us in. We have
come from a great way off.</p>

<p>But the master of the inn said, I have no room in
my inn for you.</p>

<p>What could poor Mary do? Must she sleep in
the street? Mary said she would sleep in the stable,
if the master would let her.</p>

<p>So Mary and Joseph went into the stable. There
were cows and asses in the stable.</p>

<p>While Mary was in the stable, God sent her the
little baby he had promised her. She knew he was
the Son of God, though he looked like other little
babies.</p>

<p>She wrapped him in some long clothes, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
swaddling clothes; but she had no cradle for him
to sleep in, and she could not lay him on the
ground, lest the beasts should tread upon him; so
she put him in the manger, and she sat by him to
take care of him.</p>

<p>How dearly Mary loved this sweet babe!</p>

<p>This baby had not a naughty heart, as other
babies have. Jesus had no sin, but was quite meek
and lowly. Yet other babies have cradles and soft
pillows, while Jesus lay in a manger.</p>

brother when you rock his cradle:</p>

<small>THE SHEPHERDS.<br />
<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, ii. 8-20.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> were some fields near Bethlehem. On the
night when Jesus was born, some shepherds were
sitting by their sheep in those fields. Why did
they sit up at night? To keep their sheep from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
wolves and lions which walk about at night. There
are no lions where we live, but near Bethlehem
there were some.</p>

<p>These shepherds saw a great light. A beautiful
angel came from heaven. The poor shepherds
were afraid; but the angel said, Fear not, I have
sweet news to tell you. God has sent his own Son
from heaven to save you from hell. He is a baby
now, lying in a manger. Go to Bethlehem, and
you will find him.</p>

<p>When the angel had done speaking, hundreds
and hundreds of bright angels filled the sky, and
began singing and praising God for having sent
his Son to save men.</p>

<p>At last the angels went back to heaven, and the
shepherds were left alone.</p>

<p>Did they stay with their sheep? No; they said,
Let us go and see the Son of God.</p>

<p>They ran to Bethlehem, and went to the stable of
the inn. There was a babe in the manger; Mary
and Joseph were sitting by. The shepherds said,
This is the Son of God. Angels have spoken to us
to-night, and told us where to find him.</p>

<p>All the people in Bethlehem were much surprised

<small>THE WISE MEN.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span> ii.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> were some wise and rich men. They lived
a great way from Bethlehem. They knew that God
had sent his Son to be a babe but they did not
know where to find him; so God put a beautiful
star in the sky, and God made it move toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
place where Jesus was. So the wise men left their
houses, and set out on a long journey; but first
they said, Let us bring some presents for the Son
of God: for he is a king. They took some gold,
and some sweet-smelling stuff to burn. They
looked at the star as they went. At last it stopped
over a house in Bethlehem. The wise men were
very glad indeed. They longed to see the Son of
God. They went in, and there they saw Mary and
her child Jesus: they fell down, and began to praise
him, and to call him the Son of God, and the King.</p>

<p>They took out their presents, and gave them to
him. Mary was poor; but now she had some
money to buy things for her little baby.</p>

<h2>LESSON XVI.<br />
<small>KING HEROD.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span>, ii. <span class="smcap">Luke</span>, ii. 51, 52.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a very wicked king called Herod. He
lived a little way from Bethlehem. He heard that
a babe was born in Bethlehem, and that some
people said that the babe was a king.</p>

<p>Now Herod did not like that there should be
any other king besides himself. Herod did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
like that even the Son of God should be king. So
Herod said, I will kill this babe that is called a
king.</p>

<p>Herod knew that this babe was in Bethlehem;
but there were many babes in Bethlehem, and
Herod did not know which was the babe that was
called a king.</p>

<p>Some people knew which it was; but they loved
Jesus, and they would not tell Herod. A very
wicked thought came into Herod’s mind. He
thought, I will kill all the babes in Bethlehem. Do
you think God would let Herod kill his Son? No.
God knew what Herod meant to do. God sent one
of his bright angels to speak to Joseph when he was
asleep.</p>

<p>The angel said, A wicked king wants to kill the
baby. Get up, Joseph; take Mary and the baby a
great way off. So Joseph got up quickly; he took
his ass, he put Mary on it, and she held the baby.
It was dark when they set off. Nobody saw them
go.</p>

<p>The next morning some men came with swords.
Herod had sent them. They were come to kill all
the babies. They opened every door, and said, Is
there a baby here? Then they snatched it from its
mother, and killed it, and the poor mother cried bitterly.
Had you walked down the streets, you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
have heard nothing but women weeping and crying
out, My pretty babe is dead; I shall never see it
more!</p>

<p>Was Jesus killed?</p>

<p>No: he was gone far away. His Father, God,
had sent him away. Herod could not kill him, for
God would not let him die so soon.</p>

<p>At last King Herod died. Then God sent an
angel to speak to Joseph when he was asleep. The
angel said, Joseph, go back to your own country;
Herod is dead. So Joseph took the ass, and Mary,
and the sweet child, Jesus, and they all came back
to their own country.</p>

<p>Joseph was a carpenter. Jesus lived with Joseph
and Mary, and minded all they said. He was a
wise child, and loved to think of God. God his
Father loved him, and everybody loved him, because
he was so meek and kind. The older he
grew the more they loved him.</p>

<h2>LESSON XVII.<br />
<small>THE TEMPTATION.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span> iv. 1-11.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> last Jesus grew to be a man. He knew that
he must go from place to place, and teach people
about God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>But first he went into a place by himself—called
a wilderness. He had no house to sleep in there,
no friend to speak to, no food to eat. In the night
it was cold, in the day very hot.</p>

<p>There were no men, but there were lions, wolves
and bears. At night they roared and howled; but
Jesus trusted in his Father.</p>

<p>He ate nothing for forty days and forty nights,
God kept him alive. When Jesus was alone, then
he spoke in his heart to his dear Father.</p>

<p>At last someone came and spoke to him.</p>

<p>Who was it?</p>

<p>Not a man, not a bright angel, not God; it was
Satan. I do not know how he looked. He was
come to tempt Jesus to do wickedly, and not to
mind God his Father. Satan knew that Jesus was
hungry. He said to him, Turn these stones into
bread! but Jesus would not, for God had promised
to feed him himself.</p>

<p>After that, Satan took Jesus to the top of a great
building, that was much higher than a church. It
is dreadful to be on the top of a very high place;
it makes one tremble to look down from the top.</p>

<p>Satan said to Jesus, Throw yourself down from
this place; your Father will send his angels to keep
you from being hurt, for you know that he has
promised to take care of you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Would Jesus have done right had he thrown himself
down? No: Jesus knew that his Father would
be displeased if he threw himself down; and Jesus
always did the things that pleased his Father.</p>

<p>Then Satan took him to the top of a very high
hill. He showed him the most beautiful things
in the world, gardens and houses, ships and carriages,
and fine clothes and feasts. He said, Look
at these fine things. I will give them all to you.
You shall have all the world for your own; only
kneel down and call me God.</p>

<p>But Jesus said, I will pray to my Father, and not
to you.</p>

<p>Jesus loved his Father better than all the things
in the world.</p>

<p>Adam and Eve minded Satan, and disobeyed
God; but Jesus did all his Father had told him.
Adam was disobedient, Jesus was obedient.</p>

<p>Then Satan went away, and angels came from
heaven and fed Jesus.</p>

<p>Satan goes about, trying to make children
naughty. A lion could only eat your body, but
Satan wants to have your soul and body in hell.
Satan hates you. He is your enemy. But God
is stronger than Satan. Say to God, Keep me
from minding Satan, and God will keep you.</p>

<h2>LESSON XVIII.<br />
<small>THE TWELVE DISCIPLES.<br />
<span class="smcap">Mark</span>, i. 16-20.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Jesus was a man, he began to teach people
about his Father. Jesus used to preach.</p>

<p>Where did he preach?</p>

<p>Sometimes he preached to people in a place like
a church; sometimes he preached in the fields;
sometimes he sat on the top of a hill and preached;
and sometimes he sat in a ship, and the people
stood by the edge of the water to hear him. Jesus
did not always live in the same place: he used to
walk about from one place to another.</p>

<p>Did Jesus walk about alone? No; he had twelve
friends always with him. He called them his twelve
disciples.</p>

<p>How many are twelve? Let us count the little
children in this room. Here are twelve. Jesus
had just so many disciples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>One was called Peter, and another John, and another
James, and another Thomas. I will not tell
you the names of all, lest you should forget them.</p>

<p>Peter was a fisherman. He had a little ship, and
he used to catch fish in the day and in the night.
James and John had another little ship, and they
used to catch fish.</p>

<p>One day Jesus passed by their ships, and Jesus
saw Peter and his brother Andrew throwing a net
into the sea to catch fish, and Jesus said to them,
Come with me. And Peter and Andrew left their
nets, and their ships, and went with Jesus.</p>

<p>And Jesus went a little further, and he saw James
and John sitting in their ship, mending the holes in
their nets, and Jesus said to them, Come with me;
and they left their nets and went with Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus called what people he pleased to come with
him.</p>

<p>Shall I tell you why Jesus chose to have twelve
friends always with him? What do you think was
the reason?</p>

<p>Jesus wished to teach them about God his Father,
that they might teach other people about him.
They liked being with him, and listening to his
words. Would you have liked to be always with
Jesus?</p>

<p>When Jesus was alone with his disciples, he used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to tell them secrets about God and heaven. They
loved him very much indeed; they called him Master,
and Lord. Jesus loved them still more than
they loved him, and he called them his friends.</p>

<p>Jesus used to give them part of his things. But
Jesus had no house to live in, and he had very
little money. Sometimes Jesus and his friends were
very much tired with walking far, and sometimes
they were very hungry and thirsty. But kind people
often asked them to come into their houses,
and gave them food. Other people laughed at
Jesus, and called him names.</p>

<p>Were the disciples good?—They were bad like
us; but Jesus put his Spirit into them, and made
them better. The disciples were not quite good
like Jesus; they often quarreled with each other,
and sometimes they were unkind to poor people.</p>

<h2>LESSON XIX.<br />
<small>THE FIRST MIRACLE.<br />
<span class="smcap">John</span>, ii. 1-11.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I told</span> you that some people used to ask Jesus to
come into their houses. I shall now tell you of a
man who did ask Jesus. This man gave a feast,
and Jesus came to the feast. Mary, the mother of
Jesus, came; and the disciples came. There were
a great many more people besides at the feast.</p>

<p>There was some wine for the people to drink:
but there was so little, that very soon it was all
gone.</p>

<p>Jesus knew that the wine was gone. Could not
Jesus give the people more wine?—Yes; for he
made the world and all things in it.</p>

<p>There were some large stone jars in the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Jesus said to the servants, Fill the jars with water,
and they filled them quite full.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said, Take some, and give it to the
master to drink. The servants did so; but Jesus
had turned the water into wine.</p>

<p>When the master had tasted it, he said, What
nice wine this is! Where did it come from?</p>

<p>The servants told him how Jesus had told them
to fill the jars with water. Then all the people at
the feast knew that Jesus had turned the water into
wine.</p>

<p>This was the first wonder that Jesus did; it was
called a miracle.</p>

<p>Why did Jesus do miracles? To show people
that he was the Son of God.</p>

<p>The disciples now felt quite sure that Jesus was
the Son of God.</p>

<h2>LESSON XX.<br />
<small>SEVERAL MIRACLES.<br />
<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, vi. 11-16.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> Jesus had turned the water into wine, he
did a great many wonders. He made blind people
see, and deaf people hear, and dumb people speak,
and lame people walk.</p>

<p>When Jesus came to a place, all the sick people
crowded round him.</p>

<p>Jesus did not send them away because they disturbed
him, but he cured them all—yes—every one.</p>

<p>This was the way in which he cured one blind
man. He said, See! and the man could see that
moment.</p>

<p>This was the way in which he cured a man who
was deaf and dumb. Jesus put his fingers into his
ears, and touched his tongue, and looked up to his
Father in heaven, and said, Be opened! and immediately
the string of his tongue was loosed, and
he could speak plainly.</p>

<p>Once Jesus saw a poor sick man lying on a bed,
and Jesus said to him, Should you like to be made
well? The poor man said he wished very much to
be made well. Then Jesus said, Get up, carry your
bed, and walk. The man tried to get up, and he
found that he could; for Jesus gave him strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>One day Jesus was in a place like a church; he
was preaching; when he saw a poor woman whose
back was bent, so that she could not lift up her
head. Jesus said, Woman, I have made you well;
and then Jesus touched her with his hands, and her
back grew straight, and she began to praise God.</p>

<p>Sometimes Jesus made dead people alive again.
That was more wonderful than making sick people
well.</p>

<p>Once Jesus was walking on the road. A great
many people were walking after him, for people
liked to see him do wonders, and to hear him talk.
They met some men carrying a dead man to put
him in the ground.</p>

<p>A poor old woman came after, crying very much.
She was the mother of the dead man. He was her
only son. Jesus was very sorry to see her cry.
He came up to her and said, Do not cry, and then
he touched the coffin. There was no top to it; the
dead man was lying in it.</p>

<p>Jesus said, Get up, young man. He sat up and
began to speak. Then Jesus said to his mother,
Here is your son.</p>

<p>All the people were surprised, and said, This must
be the Son of God. He can make dead people live
again.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXI.<br />
<small>THE SINNER AND SIMON.<br />
<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, vii. 36 to end.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Why</span> did Jesus come into the world?—To save us
from hell.</p>

<p>But why did God say that people must go to
hell?—Because everybody was naughty.</p>

<p>Jesus can forgive people their naughtiness, and
make them good. But Jesus will not forgive people
who are not sorry. I will tell you of a proud
man who was not sorry, and of a poor woman who
was sorry.</p>

<p>A rich proud man asked Jesus to come and dine
with him. Why did he ask Jesus? he did not love
him;—he only asked him, that he might hear him
talk: but Jesus said he would come.</p>

<p>The proud man treated Jesus very unkindly. He
gave him no water to wash his feet, put no sweet
ointment upon them, gave him no kiss.</p>

<p>A poor woman, who had been very naughty, saw
Jesus go into the rich man’s house. She came up
behind Jesus, and began to cry for all her naughtiness.
She knew Jesus could forgive her, and she
loved Jesus.</p>

<p>She had brought a box of ointment with her: she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
stooped down, and her tears fell upon Jesus’ feet,
and with her tears she washed them: she wiped
them with her long hair, and then poured the sweet
ointment upon them, and kissed them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">
<img src="images/illus069.jpg" width="432" height="600" alt="Jesus in temple" />
<div class="caption">JESUS AND THE DOCTORS.</div>
</div>

<p>The rich man looked at the woman very angrily;
he knew she had been very naughty, and he was
angry at seeing Jesus so kind to her.</p>

<p>But Jesus said to the proud man, This woman
has been very naughty: but I have forgiven
her, and she loves me very much. She loves me
a great deal more than you do. You gave me no
water for my feet; but she has washed my feet with
her tears. You gave me no kiss; but she has kissed
my feet ever since I came in. You gave me no
ointment; but she has poured very sweet ointment
upon my feet.</p>

<p>Then Jesus spoke kindly to the woman, and said
to her, Your sins are forgiven.</p>

<p>So Jesus comforted this poor woman, but the
proud man and his friends grew still more angry.</p>

<p>Jesus will forgive your sins if you are sorry, and
if you ask him; but if you think yourself good, he
will not forgive you; for Jesus cannot bear proud
people. Though you are but a little child, you have
done a great many wrong things; and you do not
deserve to go to heaven. Oh, I hope Jesus will
forgive you! I hope the Holy Spirit will come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
your heart, and make you feel very sorry for your
sins. Then Jesus will forgive you, and you will
love him, as this poor woman did.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> often went into a ship with his disciples.
Peter had a ship of his own, and John had another
ship, and they liked to lend their ships to Jesus.</p>

<p>Once they were all in a ship when the wind blew
very hard and the water moved up and down, and
came over the ship. The disciples were afraid that
they should be drowned.</p>

<p>Jesus had fallen asleep, and was lying on a pillow.
The noise of the wind and of the water had
not awakened him.</p>

<p>His disciples ran to him and cried, O Master! do
you not care for us? will you let us die?</p>

<p>Then Jesus got up and said to the wind, Wind
be still! and he said to the water, Be still! The
wind left off blowing, and the water was smooth and
quiet.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to his disciples, Why are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
afraid? Why did you not believe that I would take
care of you?</p>

<p>Jesus knew that they were tossed about, and he
would have kept them safe, though he was asleep.</p>

<p>The disciples said to one another, Jesus is the
Son of God; even the wind and the water obey him.</p>

<small>JAIRUS’ DAUGHTER.<br />
<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, viii. 41 to end.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A rich</span> man came to Jesus and fell down at his
feet and said, I have one little girl, and she is very
sick; pray come and make her well. Jesus went
with the rich man.</p>

<p>When they were near the house, some servants
came out and said, The little girl is just dead; no
one can make her well now.</p>

<p>But Jesus said, Do not be afraid; I can make her
well.</p>

<p>Jesus said to the father and mother of the little
girl, Come with me into the house. Peter, James,
and John, you may come in, but no one else.</p>

<p>So they went up into the room where the little
girl was lying in bed. A great many people were
in the room, playing sad music, and singing sad
songs, and crying, because the child was dead. But
Jesus said, Leave off crying. The girl is only sleeping:
she is not dead. Jesus said she was asleep,
because he meant to make her alive so soon again.
But the people laughed at Jesus, and said, She is
dead, and they would not believe that he could
make her alive again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus said, These people must be put out of the
room. So he sent them out, and shut the door;
but he let the father and mother, and Peter, and
James, and John, stay in the room. He took the
little girl’s hand, and said, Arise! At first she sat
up, and then she rose up out of bed, and walked
about the room. She was twelve years old. Jesus
then said, Bring her something to eat.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXIV.<br />
<small>THE LOAVES AND FISHES.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span>, xiv. 13-22.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Once</span> Jesus went into the wilderness with his disciples,
and a great many people came after him;
then Jesus preached to the people, and told them
about his Father, and how he himself had come
down from heaven to save them from Satan. They
listened to him from morning till night.</p>

<p>When it was getting dark, the disciples came to
Jesus and said, Will you not send the people home,
for it is late?</p>

<p>But Jesus knew that the people had had nothing
to eat all day, and he did not like to send them
home tired and hungry. So he said to his disciples,
Cannot you feed them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>No, said they; we have only five loaves and two
small fishes, and see how many people there are!</p>

<p>But Jesus said, Make them sit down on the grass,
and bring the loaves and fishes to me. So the disciples
made them all sit down.</p>

<p>There were a great many people, as many as
would fill ten churches—five thousand men, besides
women and little children. How tired the little
children must have been! it was time for them to
have their supper and go to bed. We shall hear
how Jesus fed all these people.</p>

<p>They sat down on the green grass. Jesus took
the loaves and fishes; first he lifted up his eyes to
his Father, and thanked him for the food, and then
he took a piece of bread and gave it to Peter, and
said, Feed all those people sitting there; and he
gave another piece to John, and said, Feed those
people; and he gave a piece of bread and fish to
each of the disciples, and told each to feed some
people.</p>

<p>One little piece of bread would not be enough for
all the children in this room; but Jesus made the
bread enough for all the people. Everyone had
enough, and they threw upon the grass a great
many little pieces. But Jesus said to his disciples,
Take some baskets, and pick up the crumbs; and
they filled twelve baskets full of little bits of bread.
Then Jesus told the people to go home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>What a wonder Jesus had done! Yet you know
that he feeds you, my little children, and all the
people in the world.</p>

<p>How does he feed you?—He gives you bread.</p>

<p>Of what is bread made?—Of flour.</p>

<p>Of what is flour made?—Of corn.</p>

<p>Who makes corn?—God makes the corn.</p>

<p>Of what does he make it?—Of nothing. God
makes things of nothing. Jesus is God, and makes
the corn grow; so you see that Jesus feeds you.
If he did not make corn grow in the fields we
should die. But he will not forget us. He even
remembers the little birds. They are too silly to
plow, or to sow corn, or to reap or to put corn
into barns, yet God does not let them starve. The
birds cry to God, and he hears them, and lets them
find food. Now God loves us much better than
he loves the little birds, because we have souls; so
he will certainly hear us when we pray to him.</p>

<p>If your mother had no bread in her cottage, and
if she could get no money to buy some, yet God
would hear her, if she loved him. He would not
let her starve. Will you not ask God for bread
every day, and say, Give me this day my daily
bread?</p>

<p>We ought to thank God for the food we eat: before
we eat breakfast, or dinner, or supper, we
should say, I thank thee, O Lord, for this nice food.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXV.<br />
<small>THE KINDNESS OF JESUS.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span>, xv. 21-28. <span class="smcap">Mark</span>, x. 13-16.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I told</span> you that the disciples were sometimes unkind;
but Jesus was always kind. Once a poor
woman came crying after Jesus, saying, O Lord, I
have a little daughter who is very sick. Jesus did
not answer her at first, and the disciples were unkind,
and wished her to be sent away. She cried
so loud, they said to Jesus, Do send her away.</p>

<p>The poor woman fell down at Jesus’ feet, and
said, Lord, help me! And Jesus had pity on the
woman, and said, I will do what you wish.</p>

<p>The poor woman was glad to hear this, and she
went home, and found that her daughter was quite
well.</p>

<p>Another time the disciples were unkind to some
little children. Some poor women brought their
children to Jesus, but the disciples were standing
round, and they would not let the women come
near. Go away, they said; you must not bring the
babies here to trouble us. But Jesus heard them
speak, and was very angry with the disciples. Jesus
would not let the children go away.</p>

<p>He said to the disciples, Suffer them to come to
me; do not send them away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he took the children in his arms, and put
his hands upon them, and prayed to his Father,
and blessed them.</p>

<p>O happy little children, to be taken into the arms
of Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus loves meek and gentle children. They are
Jesus’ lambs. Jesus is their shepherd, and he will
take them to heaven when they die.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXVI.<br />
<small>THE LORD’S PRAYER.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Jesus was in the world, he loved to think of
his Father in heaven. He liked to be alone, that
he might pray to his Father: sometimes the tears
ran down his cheeks while he prayed. One night
Jesus prayed all night alone upon the top of a high
hill.</p>

<p>Sometimes Jesus prayed to his Father while his
disciples stood near and listened.</p>

<p>Once when Jesus had been praying with them
they said, Lord, teach us to pray. Then Jesus
taught them a little prayer.</p>

<p>It was this: Our Father which art in heaven,
hallowed by thy name; thy kingdom come; thy
will be done on earth, as it is in heaven: give us
this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive them that trespass against
us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
from evil: for thine is the kingdom, and the power,
and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>I know, little children, that you say this prayer
night and morning. Your mothers taught you to
say it. But did you know who said it first? It
was Jesus, the Lord: so it is called “The Lord’s
Prayer.” It is a very beautiful prayer, for Jesus
said it; but it is hard for children to understand it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>What is the meaning of “Hallowed be thy name?”
Let God’s name be praised.</p>

<p>What are “trespasses?” Trespasses are sins.</p>

<p>Ask God to forgive your sins, or your trespasses.</p>

<p>Do you ever pray to God when you are alone?</p>

<p>You may pray to him in any <span class="smcap">PLACE</span>—in the house
or in the garden.</p>

<p>You may pray to him at any <span class="smcap">TIME</span>—in the night
or in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>You may ask him for anything you want, just
as you ask your father.</p>

<p>What will you ask him for? Will you ask him
to give you bread, and clothes, and a house to live
in?</p>

<p>Yes, ask him for these things, but most of all—ask
him for his Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>It is better to have the Holy Spirit than to have
all the toys, all the money, all the flowers, all the
birds, all the beautiful things in the world.</p>

<p>Why is it better?</p>

<p>Because the Holy Spirit will make you love God,
as the angels do, and will make you live forever
and ever.</p>

<p>Will you say this little prayer to God?—“O my
Father, pray give me thy Holy Spirit, for Christ’s
sake.”</p>

<h2>LESSON XXVII.<br />
<small>JESUS FORETELLS HIS DEATH.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span>, xvi. 21 to end.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> knew everything that would happen, and he
knew that he must soon die.</p>

<p>He used to tell his secrets to his disciples; so he
took them into a place by themselves, and said, I
soon shall leave you: the wicked people will take
me, and bind me with ropes, and beat me, and
laugh at me, and nail me on a cross; but I shall
soon be alive again.</p>

<p>The disciples could not bear to hear Jesus talk
of dying, for they loved him very much. They
all looked very sad, and Peter said, You shall not
die; but Jesus said, I must die to save men, and to
please my Father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The Father had desired Jesus to die, and he
would not disobey his Father.</p>

<p>Most of the people who wished to kill Jesus,
lived in a great town called Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Jesus used to go to Jerusalem very often, and he
used to preach there.</p>

<p>Why did some people hate Jesus?—Because he
told them of their wickedness.</p>

<p>He used to say to them, You do not love God,
who is my Father, but you are proud and vain.
You wish to kill me. You tell lies. You are unkind
to poor people. You pretend to love God, but
while you are saying your prayers, you are thinking
how good you are. Your hearts are full of wickedness.
You are the children of the devil.</p>

<p>Jesus wished them to turn from their wickedness.
It grieved him to see how they hated his Father,
and that they would not turn from their wicked
ways.</p>

<p>The wicked people were angry with Jesus, and
said, God is not your Father. But Jesus said, He
is my Father, and I came down from heaven, where
he lives, and I shall go back to him some day.</p>

<p>At last the people took up stones to throw at
him: but Jesus did not choose to die yet, so he
easily got away and went to a place where they
could not find him.</p>

<p>There he staid with his disciples a good while.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXVIII.<br />
<small>LAZARUS.<br />
<span class="smcap">John</span>, xi. 1-17.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> staid with his disciples in a place by himself.
The wicked people, who wanted to kill him,
could not find him, but Jesus’ friends knew where
he was.</p>

<p>Jesus had more friends besides his disciples.</p>

<p>One of his friends was called Lazarus. Lazarus
had two sisters; their names were Martha and
Mary. These three all lived together. They all
three loved Jesus, and Jesus loved them. Jesus
used often to come and see them, and sit in the
house and talk to them. Martha liked to make a
fine dinner when Jesus came, but Mary liked to
sit and listen to his sweet words.</p>

<p>At last Lazarus fell very sick.</p>

<p>Martha and Mary loved their brother Lazarus
very much indeed. They knew that Jesus could
make Lazarus well; so they sent a man to tell Jesus
that Lazarus was sick.</p>

<p>The man went a great way to look for Jesus.
Lazarus grew worse and worse. At last he died.
His friends wrapped white cloths round his face,
and his arms and his legs, and put him in a great
hole, and rolled a stone before it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Martha and Mary waited and longed for Jesus to
come.</p>

<p>Four days passed, and at last Jesus came. Martha
and Mary did not think that Jesus would make
Lazarus alive again, for he had been dead so long;
so they sat upon the ground and cried.</p>

<p>When Martha heard that Jesus was on the road
a little way off, she came to Jesus and said, If you
had been here, my brother had not died; and even
now you could make him alive.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said, Your brother shall rise again.</p>

<p>Yes, said Martha, I know he will rise again at
the last day, when all the dead people rise.</p>

<p>Martha was afraid that Jesus would not choose to
make Lazarus alive soon; but she knew that he
was able to do it.</p>

<p>Martha went back to the house, and found Mary
still sitting on the ground, and a great many friends
round her.</p>

<p>Martha whispered in her ear, and told her that
Jesus wanted to speak to her. So Martha and
Mary went together, and found Jesus waiting for
them in the road.</p>

<p>Mary’s friends went with her, and they cried;
and Mary cried very much indeed: and when she
saw Jesus she fell down at his feet and said, Lord,
if you had been here, my brother had not died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus was very sorry to see her so unhappy, and
to see so many people crying: he felt very sad indeed,
and he sighed very deeply. Jesus does not
like to see anyone in trouble, he is so kind.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said, Where have you put Lazarus?</p>

<p>Martha and Mary and their friends said, Come
and see; and they showed him the way.</p>

<p>As Jesus walked along, the tears rolled down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>At last they came to the grave. It was a hole,
and a very large stone was before the hole.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said, Take away the stone.</p>

<p>Martha thought that Jesus was going to look at
Lazarus lying dead; and she said, Do not go in:
his flesh has a bad smell by this time. He has
been dead four days. But Jesus told her to believe
that he could make him alive.</p>

<p>They then rolled away the stone.</p>

<p>Then Jesus lifted up his eyes to his Father in
heaven, and thanked him for helping him to do
wonderful things.</p>

<p>A great many people were standing by, looking
at Jesus, and wondering what he would do.</p>

<p>Poor Martha and Mary were longing to see Lazarus
alive again.</p>

<p>Then Jesus spoke loud and said, Lazarus, come
forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Lazarus heard, though he was dead; for the dead
hear the voice of Jesus. He got up and walked to
the door of the hole. His hands were tied with
cloths, and his feet wrapped round with cloths, and
a cloth was over his face.</p>

<p>But Jesus said, Undo the cloths.</p>

<p>How pleased Martha and Mary must have been
to see his face again! How they must have thanked
the Lord Jesus for his kindness!</p>

<p>The people who saw all this were surprised, and
said, Jesus must be the Son of God.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXIX.<br />
<small>JESUS ENTERS JERUSALEM.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span>, xxi. 1-11, 14-17.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Which</span> was the greatest miracle that Jesus ever
did? It was making Lazarus alive again; because
he had been dead four days.</p>

<p>Many of the wicked people who hated Jesus
heard of it; but they only hated him the more.
They said, We must kill him soon, or everyone will
believe that he is the Son of God.</p>

<p>Jesus knew that they wanted to kill him, and so
he went again and hid himself in a place they did
not know of. They looked for him, but they could
not find him.</p>

<p>But could Jesus always stay in that little quiet
place, where he was hid with his disciples? No.
He came down to die for us. He only waited till
the time came for him to die. Then he said to his
disciples, We must go to Jerusalem, and I shall be
laughed at, and beaten, and killed; but I shall come
out of my grave after three days.</p>

<p>The disciples did not like to hear this; but they
chose to go with Jesus wherever he went.</p>

<p>Jesus walked fast along the road; at last he came
near Jerusalem. Then he stopped and said to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
disciples, I shall ride into Jerusalem upon an ass.
Jesus had no ass of his own; he always walked from
place to place. But Jesus could put it into a man’s
heart to lend him one.</p>

<p>He said to two of his disciples, Go along the road
a little way, and you will see an ass and a young
ass tied, and a man standing near; bring the ass
and the young one to me, for I know that the man
will let them come.</p>

<p>So the two disciples went: when they had gone a
little way they saw an ass tied up, and a young one.
They began to untie the ass; but a man standing
near said, Why do you untie the ass?</p>

<p>They said, The Lord hath need of them; and then
the man let them go.</p>

<p>I suppose that man loved the Lord Jesus, and
liked to lend him his things.</p>

<p>The two disciples brought the two asses to Jesus.
They took off some of their clothes, and put them
on the young ass, and Jesus sat upon it.</p>

<p>A great many people came out of Jerusalem to
see Jesus, for they had heard of his making Lazarus
alive again. The people began to praise Jesus, and
call him king. They took off some of their clothes,
and laid them down upon the road for the ass to
tread upon; and they picked branches off the trees
that grew near, and laid them too on the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>So Jesus came to the great town of Jerusalem:
all the people came into the streets to look at him,
and even the little children began to praise him,
and to call him King. The proud men, that hated
Jesus, were very angry at hearing all these praises.
They did not like to hear Jesus praised. They
came to him and said, Why do you let these children
call you king?</p>

<p>But Jesus liked to hear the children sing his
praise, and he would not tell them to be silent.</p>

<p>Jesus loved little children, and these little children
loved Jesus.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXX.<br />
<small>THE TEMPLE.<br />
<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, xix. 47, 48; xx. 19, 20; xxi. 37, 38.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a large place in Jerusalem, like a great
church, called the Temple. It was white outside,
and very beautiful. The doors were open all day,
and people used to go in to pray to God. It was
God’s house: Jesus used often to be there with his
disciples. Poor blind and lame people came to him
there, and Jesus cured them all, and talked to them
about his Father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The little children sang his praises in the Temple.
All day long Jesus taught the people about God,
and they listened to what he said, and liked to hear
him.</p>

<p>The wicked and proud men came to the Temple
to laugh at Jesus, and to speak rudely to him; but
he bore all as meekly as a lamb.</p>

<p>At night he left the Temple, and went out of the
town to a high hill, where he prayed to God alone
in the dark.</p>

<p>The wicked men longed to catch Jesus to kill
him. They said to each other, How can we get
him? the people will not let us take hold of him
if they see us, or we would go to the Temple to
catch him. If we could find him alone in the dark,
then we would put ropes on him, and take him to
the judge. This is what the wicked people said to
each other as they sat together.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXXI.<br />
<small>JUDAS.<br />
<span class="smcap">John</span>, xii. 6. <span class="smcap">Matthew</span>, xxvi. 3, 4, 14-16.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> had twelve disciples. Did they all love him?</p>

<p>Peter loved Jesus, and John loved him, and all
the rest loved him, but one; his name was Judas.
He did not love Jesus, but only pretended to love
him. He was like the devil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Did Jesus know how wicked Judas was? Yes,
he saw into his heart; but the disciples thought
Judas was good; for Judas used to kiss the Lord
Jesus, and speak kindly to him, and talk about God
like the rest.</p>

<p>But Judas loved something; he loved money.
He wanted to get a great deal of money.</p>

<p>He was covetous, and he was a thief. The disciples
had a bag, and when they had money they
put it in the bag; and all the disciples put their
money in the same bag. But there was very little
money in the bag, for they were very poor. Judas
used to take care of the bag, and he used to steal
some of the money out of it, and keep it for himself;
but no one found him out, or thought he was
a thief, except Jesus, and he knew it well.</p>

<p>Judas was always thinking, How shall I get
money?</p>

<p>One day, when the proud men were sitting together,
Judas came in. Judas said to them, You
want to find Jesus when he is alone: will you give
me some money, and I will show you where he goes
at night?</p>

<p>The proud people said, Yes, we will.</p>

<p>Judas said, How much money will you give me?</p>

<p>They said, Thirty pieces of silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Judas said, Some night I will bring you to
Jesus when he is alone.</p>

<p>The wicked people were very glad to hear this.</p>

<p>Now, thought they, we shall soon catch him and
kill him.</p>

<p>Judas went back to Jesus, but he did not tell the
disciples what he had done. Jesus knew what he
had been doing; for Jesus could see all his thoughts,
and he knew all that Judas did, both in the day and
in the night. Yet Jesus did not tell Judas that he
knew his wicked plans.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> said to his disciples, I am going soon to be
killed, but before I die I shall eat a supper with you
in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to Peter and John, Go and get
the supper ready; but they said, Where shall we
get it ready? For Jesus had no house in Jerusalem:
but Jesus knew how to find a room.</p>

<p>So Jesus said to Peter and John, Go into Jerusalem,
and you will meet a man carrying a jug; go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
after him: he will go into a house. The master of
the house will lend me a room. Tell him that I
am going to die, and that I want to eat a supper
with my disciples.</p>

<p>Then Peter and John went into Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Whom did they meet? A man carrying a jug.</p>

<p>They followed him. He went into a house. Peter
and John went in after him, and they said to the
master of the house, Jesus wants a room to eat
supper in with his disciples before he dies.</p>

<p>Then the master took them up stairs, and showed
them a large room, with a table in it, and seats all
round the table, and a jug, and a basin to wash
their feet in, and a cup and dishes.</p>

<p>Then Peter and John got some bread and wine
and other things, and made the supper ready; and
they went back and told Jesus (who was a little way
in the country) that supper was ready. So Jesus
and all his disciples came to the house in the evening;
they went up stairs, and they all sat down.</p>

<p>Jesus loved John better than all the rest, and
John sat next to Jesus.</p>

<p>After they had been a little while at supper, Jesus
got up and took a towel, and tied it round his
waist; and he took a jug and poured water into a
basin, and he began to wash his disciples’ feet, and
to wipe them with the towel round his waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>But when he came to Peter, Peter said, You shall
never wash my feet.</p>

<p>Peter thought it was too kind of Jesus to wash
his feet, as if he were a servant; but Jesus was not
proud, but loved to be kind to his disciples.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to Peter, If I wash you not, you
cannot be mine; but I have made you clean already.
Jesus had made Peter’s heart clean.</p>

<p>Then Peter was glad that Jesus should wash his
feet.</p>

<p>All the disciples had clean hearts, except Judas,
and his heart was full of wickedness; Satan was in
it. Yet Jesus washed Judas’ feet. He was kind
even to wicked Judas, who hated him.</p>

<p>When Jesus had washed all the disciples’ feet he
sat down again, and began to talk to them.</p>

<p>He said, Do you know what I have done to you?
I have washed your feet, though I am your Lord
and Master. I wish to teach you to be as kind to
each other as I have been to you.</p>

<span class="smcap">John</span>, xiii. 21-30.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> know the wicked thing that Judas meant to
do. Jesus knew that he would bring the wicked
people to take him and kill him. Jesus had been
very kind to Judas, and Jesus was sorry that he was
so wicked.</p>

<p>As Jesus was sitting at supper, and all the twelve
disciples sitting round, he said, One of you will give
me to the wicked men to be killed! one of you, my
disciples.</p>

<p>All the disciples were very sorry, and Peter said,
Is it I? and John said, Is it I? and each of them
said, Is it I? but Jesus did not tell them which.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Now John was leaning his head on Jesus’ bosom,
and Peter whispered to John and said, Do ask the
Lord which it is that will show the wicked people
where he is?</p>

<p>So John whispered and said, Which is it?</p>

<p>And Jesus said, The one that dips the bread in
the sop with me.</p>

<p>For there was a dish of sauce on the table, and
Jesus dipped his bread in it, and as he dipped it
one of the disciples put his hand in the dish too.
Which was it?</p>

<p>Judas: he dipped his bread in the dish with Jesus.
So John knew which it was that was so wicked.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to Judas, Go, and do what you
mean to do.</p>

<p>And Judas got up and went out of the room.</p>

<p>Where did he go?</p>

<p>He went to the wicked people, to bring them to
Jesus in the dark. But the disciples thought he
was going to buy something at a shop, or to give
money to the poor.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> supper Jesus took some bread and broke it
in little bits, and gave a piece to each of the disciples,
and said, This is my body: I am going to die:
eat this, and think of me.</p>

<p>Then Jesus poured some wine into a cup, and
told them all to drink out of it. He said, This is
my blood; I shall soon bleed and die; drink this,
and think of me.</p>

<p>Jesus said, I shall not eat supper with you again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
before I die. I am going to my Father; I must
leave you, but I shall come back again.</p>

<p>Then they all sang a hymn.</p>

<p>Afterward Jesus got up from the table and went
down stairs into the street, and the disciples followed
him. It was dark; but Jesus talked to them
as they went along. He said, I am going to die
to-night, and you will all leave me.</p>

<p>But Peter said, I will not leave you; I will go to
prison with you; I will die with you; but I will
never leave you.</p>

<p>Jesus said to him, Yes, you will, Peter; you will
say that you do not know me; you will say that
you are not my friend. This night, Peter, you will
say so, before the cock crows. (For cocks crow
in the morning when it is light.)</p>

<p>Jesus talked sweetly to his disciples. He said,
Do not be sorry because I am going away. I shall
go back to my Father, and I shall soon come back
to you. When I am in heaven, I shall get ready
a place in heaven for you. I command you to love
one another, and I will send the Holy Spirit to
comfort you.</p>

<p>At last Jesus came to a garden. He had often
been to that garden with his disciples, and wicked
Judas knew the place.</p>

<p>Where was Judas now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>He was with the wicked, proud men.</p>

<p>You will soon hear how he came to the garden,
and how he brought the <i>servants</i> of the wicked men
with him. For these wicked men meant to send
their servants to catch Jesus.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXXV.<br />
<small>THE GARDEN.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span>, xxvi. 30-57. <span class="smcap">John</span>, xviii. 1-12.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Jesus was come to the garden, he told all
his disciples to stop in one place till he came back,
except three that he took with him.</p>

<p>Who were they?</p>

<p>Peter, James, and John. He took them further
on in the garden, and then said to them, I feel very
sad indeed. I am going to pray. Do you stay
here. Do not go to sleep, but pray while I am
praying.</p>

<p>Then Jesus went a little way off by himself, and
fell upon the ground, and began to pray to his
Father to help him. He ended his prayer by saying,
O Father, do thou what thou wilt, not what I
will.</p>

<p>He prayed very earnestly, and he felt so unhappy
that the blood came out of his skin, and fell on the
ground. Then he got up and went back to Peter,
and James, and John, but he found them asleep.
He waked them, and told them to pray.</p>

<p>Then he went back and prayed again to his
Father, to help him in his great sorrow; then he
came back to his disciples, but they had fallen asleep
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Jesus prayed again, and his Father sent an
angel from heaven to comfort him. I do not know
what the angel said, but I know the angel loved
him, and could speak sweet words to him, and tell
him how his Father loved him. The angel did not
stay long; he soon went back to God.</p>

<p>Then Jesus came again to his disciples, and found
them still asleep. But Jesus waked them and told
them to get up; for Judas is near.</p>

<p>While Jesus was saying this, a great many people
were seen walking in the garden. These were the
servants of the proud men in Jerusalem. They had
swords, and sticks, and lanterns in their hands.
And Judas went before them to show them where
Jesus was. But Judas came up slily to Jesus, and
gave him a kiss, pretending to love him.</p>

<p>Jesus knew what Judas was doing, and he said,
Friend, why do you come here? and why do you
kiss me?</p>

<p>Jesus did not run away, but he went up to the
wicked men, and said, Whom are you looking for?</p>

<p>They said, For Jesus.</p>

<p>He said, I am he.</p>

<p>When he said that, God made all the wicked people
fall upon their backs upon the ground. Then
Jesus could have run away; but he chose to stay,
that he might die for sinners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The wicked people soon got up; God let them
get up; but Jesus said to them, If you want to have
me, you must let my disciples go away.</p>

<p>It was kind of Jesus to think of them, and they
were frightened and glad to get away; they did not
wish to stay to die with Jesus.</p>

<p>But Peter took a sword and cut off one of the
wicked men’s ears. Peter wished to fight; but
Jesus said, Put up your sword. If I were to pray
now to my Father, he would send thousands of
angels to help me. Then Jesus touched the man’s
ear, and made it well.</p>

<p>Why did not Jesus pray to God to send the
angels?</p>

<p>Because he chose to die to save us. Had the
angels come, and taken Jesus back to heaven, then
we should all have gone to hell.</p>

<p>Peter and all the rest of the disciples ran away,
and left Jesus quite alone with the wicked men.
They took ropes, and tied his hands and feet, and
they led him away into Jerusalem; and he went
along meekly as a lamb.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXXVI.<br />
<small>PETER’S DENIAL.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span>, xxvi. 57 to end.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> wicked proud men, who hated Jesus, had sat
up all night. They had sent their servants with
some soldiers to fetch Jesus. They were in a fine
house seated on seats round the room, talking together,
and longing for Jesus to be brought.</p>

<p>They said one to another, We will have him killed
when he comes—we will take him to the judge.</p>

<p>At last Jesus came in with the wicked servants.
The proud men were glad to see him. They made
him stand up in the midst of the large room. Then
they spoke roughly. Are you the Son of God? they
said.</p>

<p>And Jesus said, Yes, I am; and one day you will
see me coming in the clouds with the angels.</p>

<p>Then the wicked men were angry.</p>

<p>Do you hear what he says? they cried out. He
calls himself the Son of God! He must be taken
to the judge to be killed.</p>

<p>Jesus stood meekly all this while, and hardly
spoke a word.</p>

<p>What was become of his disciples? They had
run away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Had Peter run away? Peter said he would die
with Jesus. But he ran away too.</p>

<p>At last Peter thought, I will go and look for
Jesus; I should like to see what the wicked men are
doing to him.</p>

<p>So Peter came to Jerusalem, and into the fine
house. He came into the hall first: the wicked servants
were sitting round a fire in the hall; a door
was open, and through the door Peter could see
Jesus. There he was, standing before the wicked
men. Peter hoped that nobody would know that
he was one of Jesus’ disciples, lest he should be
killed. But as Peter was sitting by the fire, warming
himself, a maid said to him, You are one of the
disciples of Jesus.</p>

<p>Then Peter was frightened, and said, No, I am
not; I do not know the man you speak of.</p>

<p>Then Peter got up, and went outside the door;
but another maid said to him, I am sure you are
one of the disciples of Jesus.</p>

<p>Peter said, I am not. So Peter went back again
to the fire, and began talking with the servants.</p>

<p>But some of them remembered having seen Peter
in the garden, and they came to Peter and said, We
are certain that you are one of the disciples. I saw
you in the garden, said one.</p>

<p>Then Peter began to swear, and to say that he
was not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>While Peter was speaking so wickedly he heard
a cock crow. Then Peter remembered what Jesus
had said, and he looked at Jesus, and Jesus turned
round his face and looked at Peter. It was such
a look! Jesus did not speak, but his look seemed
to say, Is this Peter, my friend, who said he would
die with me? Is this his love for me? Does he say
he does not know me?</p>

<p>Peter felt very sorry; he felt as if his heart would
break, and he went out of the house, and began to
cry very much indeed. For Peter did really love
Jesus; only Satan had tempted him to be so wicked
as to say he did not know him.</p>

<p>If Peter had prayed in the garden instead of
going to sleep, he would have behaved better. But
Christ had often prayed for Peter, that Satan might
not get his soul at last.</p>

<span class="smcap">John</span>, xviii. 22 to end. <span class="smcap">Matthew</span>, xxvi. 67, 68.
<span class="smcap">John</span>, xix. 1-16.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> night long, Jesus stood in the great room; he
heard all Peter said, and that must have grieved
him. The wicked people were like lions and tigers,
and Jesus like a lamb. They looked at him as if
they hated him.</p>

<p>Once when he spoke, a servant slapped his face;
but he bore this meekly.</p>

<p>The judge was not up yet, for it was night; so
the wicked people were forced to wait till the morning.</p>

<p>That night the servants came round Jesus and
beat him, and pushed him, and laughed at him, and
even spat in his face.</p>

<p>When the morning came, the wicked people said,
Now we will bring him to the judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>So they went out of their fine house and took
Jesus with them.</p>

<p>The judge sat upon a high seat in the hall. His
name was Pontius Pilate. The judge did not know
Jesus. The judge said, What has he done?</p>

<p>The wicked people said, He calls himself a king.</p>

<p>Then Pilate said to Jesus, Are you a king? And
Jesus said, Yes, I am. But Pilate thought that he
looked very good, and he did not want to punish
him.</p>

<p>Then the wicked men made a great noise, and
said, You must crucify him.</p>

<p>Pilate said, No, I will beat him, and that will be
enough. So Pilate gave Jesus to some soldiers,
who took him into a house and beat him with
knotted ropes, (this way of beating is called scourging,)
and all the blood ran down his back. Then
the cruel soldiers laughed at him because he said
he was a king. They took off his own clothes, and
put some fine clothes on him such as kings wear,
purple and red.</p>

<p>Then they said, We must put a crown on his
head. So they took prickly thorns, sharp like pins,
and twisted them together, and made a crown, and
put it on his head.</p>

<p>They said He must have a scepter, (for kings
hold something called a scepter in their hands), so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
they put a reed in his hand for a scepter; then they
took it from him, and beat him on the head: and
they knelt down to him laughing, and said, O king!
O king!</p>

<p>Pilate saw the soldiers tormenting him, and he
brought Jesus into the street, where the wicked people
were, and he showed Jesus to them, and said,
Look at your king.</p>

<p>Pilate hoped they would be sorry to see him so
ill-used; blood upon his forehead from the thorns,
and his back scourged, and dressed in fine clothes
to mock him: but the wicked people were cruel like
tigers.</p>

<p>Said they, Crucify him! Crucify him! All the
people cried out, Crucify him! though Jesus had
always been so kind to them.</p>

<p>Will you crucify your king? said Pilate.</p>

<p>He shall not be our king, the people said. There
was a very great noise in the street, from the people
all speaking at once.</p>

<p>Then Pilate thought he would please the wicked
people, and he said, Take him and crucify him.
Then the people were glad. But first the soldiers
took the fine clothes off Jesus, and put his own
clothes on him again.</p>

<p>How wicked it was of Pilate to let him be crucified!
Pilate thought Jesus was good, yet he let
him be killed to please the people.</p>

<h2>LESSON XXXVIII.<br />
<small>DEATH OF JUDAS.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span>, xxvii. 3-5.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Where</span> was Judas all this while? The wicked people
had given him the money, thirty pieces of silver:
but Judas could not be happy.</p>

<p>Ah! thought he, I have killed my good Master!
what a wicked thing I have done!</p>

<p>Judas felt that he could not like the money: he
could not bear to keep it, because he had done such
a wicked thing to get it. So Judas went to look
for the wicked men. They had been sitting up all
night talking against Jesus: but now they were in
God’s house—the Temple.</p>

<p>Judas brought the thirty pieces of silver in his
hands, and threw them down on the floor near the
wicked men. Judas said, I have done a very wicked
thing.</p>

<p>But the men did not care for <i>that</i>: all they wanted
was to get Jesus killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>They picked up the pieces of silver from the floor,
and went and bought a field with the money.</p>

<p>And where did Judas go?</p>

<p>He went out to the field to kill himself. He did
not go and ask Jesus to forgive him, but went and
hanged himself. I suppose he tied a rope around
his neck, and fastened the rope to a tree. Afterward
he fell down from the tree, and his body burst,
and his blood was poured out on the ground. O
what a horrible sight it must have been! But it
was more horrible to think where Judas’ soul was
gone. It was gone to hell—to Satan.</p>

<p>It was very wicked of Judas to hang himself, instead
of praying to God to forgive him.</p>

<p>Judas is in the wicked place now; and Jesus will
judge him at the last day, and say, Depart, you
cursed!</p>

<h2>LESSON XXXIX.<br />
<small>THE CROSS—PART I.<br />
<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, xxiii. 26-34.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> wicked people were very glad when Pilate said
Jesus was to be crucified. They made a cross of
two great pieces of wood like boards, and made
Jesus carry it. They took him out of Jerusalem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
into the country. The wicked people came with
him.</p>

<p>Jesus was so weak that he could hardly walk, and
the cross was so heavy that he could not carry it.
He would have dropped down on the way, if a
man had not helped him to carry the cross.</p>

<p>There were a few people who were sorry for the
Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>Some women, who loved him very much, came
crying after him. Jesus heard them crying, and
he turned round and spoke very kindly to them.</p>

<p>He said, Do not cry for me; cry for yourselves,
and for your children. Why did Jesus tell them to
cry for themselves? Ah! Jesus knew how God
would one day punish the people in Jerusalem for
their wickedness.</p>

<p>At last Jesus came to the top of a hill. Then the
soldiers made Jesus lie upon his cross, and they put
nails in his hands, and nails in his feet. So they
nailed him to the cross. Then the soldiers made a
hole in the ground, and stuck the cross in it.</p>

<p>They had taken off Jesus’ clothes; and when he
was on the cross four soldiers tore the clothes in
four pieces, and each took a piece: but when they
looked at his coat they said, We will not tear it,
because there is no seam in it; then one of the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
took it for his own. So the wicked people
took everything away from Jesus.</p>

<p>Was Jesus very angry with them?</p>

<p>No, he was meek as a lamb. He prayed to his
Father while he was upon the cross; he could not
lift up his hands, but he could speak to God. He
prayed for these wicked people, and said, Father,
forgive them; for they know not what they do.</p>

<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, xxiii. 35-43.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Pontius Pilate</span> wrote these words on the top of
Jesus’ cross: This is the King of the Jews.</p>

<p>Who were the Jews?</p>

<p>The people who lived in Jerusalem were called
Jews.</p>

<p>All the wicked people laughed when they read
these words; they shook their heads, and pouted
their lips at Jesus, and said, If you are the Son of
God, come down from the cross.</p>

<p>Could Jesus have come down?</p>

<p>He could do everything; but he chose to stay to
die for sinners.</p>

<p>The wicked people said, If God loved him, he
would not leave him to die on the cross.</p>

<p>But his Father let him die to save us.</p>

<p>There was a cross on each side of Jesus, and a
thief nailed upon each cross. One of these thieves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
laughed at Jesus; he said, Why do you not save us,
if you are the son of God?</p>

<p>The other thief was sorry for his sins, and he
loved Jesus.</p>

<p>The thief who was sorry said to the other thief,
We have been naughty, we deserve to be crucified;
but Jesus is quite good. Then he spoke to Jesus,
and said, Remember me when you come to be king.</p>

<p>And Jesus said, You shall be with me in heaven

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Jesus’</span> mother, Mary, stood near the cross. She
came to see her son die. She was very sorry; she
felt her heart full of pain at the sight.</p>

<p>She loved her dear, good son, who had been kind
to her ever since he was a baby, and had never done
one thing wrong, and she knew he was the Son of
God. Jesus was sorry to see his mother’s grief.</p>

<p>John had come to the cross, and he was standing
near Mary. Jesus wished John to take care of his
mother, now that he was going to leave her. So
he said to his mother, Behold thy son. And he
said to John, Behold thy mother. John knew what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Jesus meant, and he took Mary to be his mother,
and made her live with him. Jesus loved his
mother, and thought of her when he was dying.</p>

<p>Jesus was full of pain, and it was very hot. He
said, I thirst! and the soldiers took a sponge, and
dipped it in vinegar, and put it on a reed and gave
it to Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus just tasted the vinegar, and said, It is finished!
and then he died. His spirit went to his
Father, but his body hung upon the cross.</p>

<p>It was three o’clock in the afternoon when Jesus
died. He had been nailed to the cross all the day.
Before Jesus died, God had made it very dark, to
show he was angry with the wicked people. And
God made the earth shake, and the people were
frightened; and when Jesus was dead, some of them
said, This must have been the Son of God.</p>

<h2>LESSON XLII.<br />
<small>THE SOLDIERS.<br />
<span class="smcap">John</span>, xix. 32-37.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> last the soldiers came to see if Jesus and the two
thieves were dead, that they might bury them before
night. The soldiers looked at one thief, and
they saw that he was not dead; so they broke his
legs, and that killed him. Then they looked at the
other thief, and they saw he was not dead; so
they broke his legs. Then they looked at Jesus,
and they saw he was dead, so they did not
break his legs: but one of the soldiers took a long
stick with a sharp point at the end, called a spear,
and put it in his side; and out of his side blood and
water came flowing upon the ground. John was
standing near, and he saw the blood poured out.
Do you remember how Jesus, at supper the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
before, had poured wine in a cup, and said, This
is my blood, which is shed for sinners?</p>

<p>Now his blood was poured out.</p>

<p>The spear made a hole in Jesus’ side. There was
a hole in his side, and a hole in each hand, and a
hole in each foot; and his forehead was pricked with
thorns, and his eyes had shed many tears, and blood
had come from his skin. All this he suffered for us,
that God might forgive us our sins.</p>

<span class="smcap">John</span>, xix. 38 to end. <span class="smcap">Luke</span>, xxiii. 55, 56. <span class="smcap">Matthew</span>,
xxvii. 60.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> was one rich man who loved Jesus; his
name was Joseph (not Mary’s husband, this was
another Joseph); he had a garden, and in the garden
he had made a grave: perhaps he meant to be
buried there himself when he came to die.</p>

<p>But now Joseph thought, I should like to put the
Lord Jesus in my grave. It was a very nice grave,
and no one had ever been put there yet.</p>

<p>So Joseph went to Pontius Pilate, and said, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
want the dead body of Jesus: may I take it down
from the cross, and keep it myself?</p>

<p>And Pilate said, Yes, you may have it.</p>

<p>Then Joseph was glad. He bought some nice
white clean linen. What do you think that was
for? To wrap Jesus in. And he bought some
spices (sweet-smelling things that grow out of the
ground), and he brought some men with him, and
they took the nails out of Jesus’ hands and feet, and,
took his body down from the cross. Then Joseph
wrapped a cloth round his head, and another cloth
round his waist, and he put sweet spices on him;
and then some men carried him along to Joseph’s
garden.</p>

<p>In the garden there was a high place called a
rock, and a hole in the rock, like a hole in a wall;
and they walked into this large dark hole, and they
laid Jesus down quite alone. Now he was at rest;
he felt no pain, no sorrow: the wicked people were
not near; and there lay the Lord in his quiet grave.
The men took a very large stone and stopped up
the hole, so that nobody could get in. No beast,
no bird, could touch the Lord Jesus. There were
trees and flowers near him in this sweet garden,
and there were angels there watching over him,
though no one could see them.</p>

<p>Where were the poor women who loved Jesus?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>They had been looking at him on the cross. How
they must have cried when they saw him bleed, and
heard him cry out to God!</p>

<p>The poor women had seen the men take him
down from the cross. They had followed the men
into the garden; they had seen him put so carefully
in his grave.</p>

<p>They said to each other, Let us get more spices,
and make sweet ointment to put on the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>Joseph had put some spices, but they wanted to
put more. So they went home and made nice ointment.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">One</span> morning very early, when Jesus had been dead
only two days, the poor women came into the garden.
It was not quite light yet, for the sun was just
rising.</p>

<p>As the women walked along with their ointment
they said to each other, How shall we get into the
grave? The men put a large stone before it; the
stone is so big, we cannot roll it away. The women
did not know what to do.</p>

<p>At last they came to the grave, but the stone was
rolled away. The women were quite surprised.
Then they were afraid some wicked people had
rolled it away, and stolen the body of Jesus. This
made them very sad; they looked into the grave,
and saw that Jesus was not there. Soon they saw
two beautiful angels standing by them. Their faces
were bright like the sun, their clothes whiter than
snow.</p>

<p>The women trembled when they saw the angels;
but the angels spoke sweetly and kindly to them,
saying, Do not be afraid; we know that you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
looking for Jesus. He is not here now; he is alive.
Do you not remember how he said he would come
to life again, after he had been crucified?</p>

<p>Come, said the angels, and look at the place
where Jesus lay. Run quickly, and tell his disciples
that Jesus is alive, and that they shall see him very
soon.</p>

<p>The women were very glad indeed; they ran as
quickly as they could to tell the disciples. But as
they were running, whom do you think they saw?
Jesus himself! He did not look as he once had
looked; no tears were on his cheeks; they were all
wiped away. He was not weak and faint as when
he had carried his cross. He never could be sick
any more; nor could he ever die again.</p>

<p>How much pleased the women were to see him!
They knelt down on the ground, and held his feet
that he might not go away, and they called him
their Lord and their God. Yet still they felt a little
afraid; but Jesus told them not to be afraid. Jesus
said: Go, tell my brothers that I shall soon see them
again.</p>

<p>Whom did Jesus call his brothers?</p>

<p>His disciples. He had forgiven them for having
run away when the wicked men took him.</p>

<p>The poor women ran, as Jesus had told them, to
the disciples, and said, We have seen angels; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
have seen the Lord Jesus! He is walking about,
and you will see him soon. But the disciples would

no angels; so she came running back, and told
Peter and John that Jesus was not in his grave. I
am afraid, said Mary Magdalene, that some wicked
people have taken him away, and that we shall not
be able to find him.</p>

<p>So Peter and John began to run as fast as they
could, but John ran the fastest, and he came first to
the grave. He stooped down and peeped in, and
he saw the clothes lying in the grave.</p>

<p>Soon after Peter came, and he went down into
the grave, and he saw the clothes neatly folded,
and the cloth that was round Jesus’ head lying in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
place by itself. Then John went in, too; and John
thought of what Jesus had said about being alive
again.</p>

<p>It is all true, thought John; he is alive, and has
left his grave.</p>

<p>Then Peter and John came out of the grave, and
went to their own house; but they saw no angels,
nor did they see Jesus.</p>

<p>Where was Mary Magdalene all this time?</p>

<p>She was standing crying outside the grave: she
was quite alone; for Peter and John were gone
home.</p>

<p>At last she stooped down and looked into the
grave, and she saw a beautiful sight—two angels,
one sitting where Jesus’ head had been, and one
where his feet had been!</p>

<p>The angels said to Mary, Why do you cry? but
still she went on crying, and said, Some people
have taken away the Lord Jesus, and I cannot find
him!</p>

<p>When she had said this, she heard a man behind
her saying, Why do you cry?</p>

<p>She did not know who it was that spoke; she
thought perhaps it was the gardener. If you have
taken him, said she, tell me where you have put
him, and I will take him away.</p>

<p>The man said, Mary! She knew that voice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
turning round she looked, and saw that it was Jesus.
How glad she was to see her Lord and Master,
whom she loved! But Jesus could not stay with
her. He told her to go and tell his dear disciples
that he was alive. I am soon going up to my
Father in heaven; but I shall see my disciples first.</p>

<p>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples.
They were all crying, but they would not believe
what Mary said.</p>

<p>Mary was glad that she had gone to look for
Jesus. She was the first of all the people who saw
Jesus after he was alive again.</p>

<h2>LESSON XLVI.<br />
<small>THE TWO FRIENDS.<br />
<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, xxiv. 13-48.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was early in the morning that the women went
to look for Jesus. In the evening two good men
were taking a walk together in the country. As
they walked they talked about Jesus. They had
not seen him since he was alive again: they did not
know he was alive. They talked about his dying
on the cross. It made them very sad to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
about it. At last a man came and spoke to them;
they thought he was a stranger, yet he seemed to be
a kind man.</p>

<p>He said, Why do you cry? I see you are talking
of something very sad.</p>

<p>Yes, said these good men, we are talking of something
sad. Did you never hear of Jesus? What
wonderful things he did, how he cured the blind,
and dumb, and sick; and how he taught people
about God? And all the people loved him; but at
last he was crucified. We thought he had been the
Son of God: but now we are afraid he was not, for
he is dead, and we are afraid that we shall never
see him again.</p>

<p>The kind stranger was sorry to see these good
men cry. He began to talk to them, and to tell
them that Jesus was the Son of God, and that he had
been crucified to save men, and that he would rise
again, and go back to his Father.</p>

<p>This kind stranger said a great deal more. He
knew all the verses in the Bible, and told these
men a great many things they did not know. They
liked to listen to the stranger, they did not feel so
sad while he was talking.</p>

<p>At last these men came to their own house: it
was in the country. The stranger seemed as if
he was going on: but the good men said to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Pray stay at our house; it is getting dark. Come
and sup with us, and sleep here: pray, pray come in.</p>

<p>Then the stranger said he would come in.</p>

<p>The men went into a room where there was a
supper. They all three sat down together around
the table. The stranger took some bread and
broke it, and began to pray to God; and then the
two men found out who the stranger was.</p>

<p>It is the Lord! they cried; and so it was. They
looked towards him, but they could see him no
more. He opened not the door, but yet he was
gone.</p>

<p>Then the men thought of all that Jesus had said.
How sweetly he talked to us! they said; did we
not feel our hearts quite warm, while he talked to
us? they said; did we not feel our hearts quite
warm, while he was speaking about the Bible, and
telling us the meaning?</p>

<p>Do you think these men went to bed that night?
O no! they could not sleep. Let us go, said they,
and tell the disciples about our seeing Jesus. So
they left the supper, and set out in the night. They
walked quickly, and soon came to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The disciples were all shut up in a room together.
They had locked the doors to prevent the wicked
people getting in: but they let these good men come
in. The disciples were at supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>We have seen Jesus! said these good men. He
has walked with us, and talked with us; but we did
not know him till he sat down with us at supper,
and broke some bread, and gave thanks to his
Father. The disciples said, Some women have seen
him, and Peter has seen him.</p>

<p>But while they were eating supper and talking
about Jesus, they looked and saw Jesus standing in
the middle of the room. Though the door was
locked, yet he had come in.</p>

<p>How do you think the disciples felt? They were
frightened: they could not believe that it was indeed
Jesus himself.</p>

<p>Jesus spoke kindly to them. Why are you afraid?
he said. Look at my hands and feet. It is I myself.
Then Jesus showed his disciples the marks
that the nails had made in his hands and feet, and
the hole that the spear had made in his side.</p>

<p>Then the disciples saw that it was their own dear
Master. They were glad, very glad, to see him:
they had been crying ever since they had lost him.
They saw that he had forgiven them for having run
away. He said nothing to them about it: he had
even forgiven Peter. He knew that Peter loved
him, and that he was very sorry.</p>

<p>The disciples were so much surprised to see
Jesus, that they could hardly believe that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
alive. Jesus knew that they did not quite believe;
so he said, Have you anything to eat? Then the
disciples gave him a piece of fish and some honey
from their supper; and Jesus took them and began
to eat, that the disciples might see that he was really
alive.</p>

<p>Then afterward he talked to them, and told them
why he had died, and that he was going back to
his Father to pray for them.</p>

<p>That was a pleasant night for the poor disciples.
It was not like that sad night when Jesus was so
sorrowful in the garden. His sorrows were over,
and he never would feel pain any more.</p>

<h2>LESSON XLVII.<br />
<small>THOMAS.<br />
<span class="smcap">John</span>, xx. 24 to end.</small></h2>



<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> have heard how the disciples saw Jesus in the
evening. One of the disciples was not there when
Jesus came. His name was Thomas. I do not
know why he was not there.</p>

<p>When the disciples saw Thomas next, they said
to him, We have seen Jesus. On Sunday night
we saw him. He came into the room as we were
sitting together, and he spoke to us. We are sure
it was Jesus himself, because he showed us the
marks of the nails in his hands and feet, and the
hole in his side where the spear went in.</p>

<p>But Thomas would not believe the disciples. He
said, I do not think you saw Jesus himself. He
died upon the cross. I never will believe, except
I put my fingers into the marks of the nails, and put
my hand into the hole in his side.</p>

<p>It was very wrong of Thomas to speak in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
way. He should have remembered that Jesus had
promised to be alive again.</p>

<p>Jesus heard Thomas speak, though Thomas could
not see him. But Jesus was always with the disciples
and heard all they said, because he is God.</p>

<p>Next Sunday evening the disciples were in a
room together. Thomas was there too. The doors
were locked to keep the wicked people out; but
the disciples knew that Jesus could come in. And
he did come. They saw him standing in the middle
of the room. He spoke kindly to them, and said,
Peace be unto you!</p>

<p>Then he spoke to Thomas. Come, said he to
Thomas, here are my hands; put your finger in the
marks: and here is the hole in my side; put your
hand in it.</p>

<p>Now Thomas knew that Jesus had heard him
speak so naughtily, and he felt ashamed and sorry.
He saw it was Jesus himself, and he cried out, My
Lord and my God!</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to Thomas, Now you have seen,
you believe. Blessed are they who have not seen,
and yet have believed.</p>

<p>Jesus quite forgave Thomas for what he had said,
because Thomas really loved Jesus.</p>

<h2>LESSON XLVIII.<br />
<small>THE DINNER.<br />
<span class="smcap">John</span>, xxi. 1-19.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> told his disciples to go a great way into the
country, and he said, I will come and see you again.
So the disciples went away from Jerusalem, and
they went into the country. They came to the
place where they had once lived, by the water side.
They had some ships on the water, and they used
to catch fish when they were in the ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>One night Peter said to the disciples, I shall go
and fish; and the disciples said, We will go
with you. So they got into a ship, and all night
long they tried to catch fish, but they could not
catch any.</p>

<p>In the morning they were tired and hungry.
They looked up, and saw a man standing near the
water side. They did not know who the man was.</p>

<p>The man called out to them and said, Children,
have you anything to eat?</p>

<p>The poor disciples said, No; for they had caught
no fish all night.</p>

<p>The man said, Let down your net on the right
side of the ship, and you shall find some fish.</p>

<p>They did as the man told them, and they caught
such a number of fishes in the net, that they could
hardly lift it out of the water.</p>

<p>Now John found out who the man was: he said
to Peter, It is the Lord.</p>

<p>Peter was very glad, and he jumped into the
water, and swam first to Jesus. The other disciples
came soon after in their little ship, with their nets
and their fishes. Jesus knew that they were tired
and hungry. By the water side there was a fire,
and some fish on the fire, and some bread. How
kind it was of Jesus to give some food to his poor
hungry disciples!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fishes that
you have caught. So Peter went and took up the
net and found it full of great fishes: one hundred
and fifty-three.</p>

<p>This was a great miracle that Jesus had done.
Then said Jesus to the disciples, Come and dine.
So they all sat down to dine together. Then Jesus
took the bread, and gave some to each; and he
took the fish, and gave some of it to each.</p>

<p>Now the disciples were quite sure that it was
Jesus who was feeding them. This was the way
they used to dine together before Jesus had died.
Now he was alive, they dined together again: but
they knew he was not going to stay long with them.</p>

<p>When they had all finished eating, Jesus said to
Peter, Do you love me?</p>

<p>Peter said, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said, Feed my lambs, (that is, Teach
other people to love me. Go and tell people about
my dying for them).</p>

<p>You, my little children, are Christ’s lambs, and
I feed you when I talk to you about Christ. I
feed your souls, and the food is the love of Jesus.</p>

<p>Peter did love Jesus, and Jesus knew he did. Yet
Jesus said again, Do you love me? Peter said
again, Lord, you know I love you. Then Jesus
said, Feed my sheep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus asked Peter once more the same thing, Do
you love me?</p>

<p>Peter was afraid Jesus did not believe him, and
this made him sorry. He said, Lord, you know
everything. You know that I love you.</p>

<p>Jesus said again, Feed my sheep.</p>

<p>If Peter loved Jesus he would do what Jesus
bade him, and go and teach people.</p>

<p>Do you love Jesus, my little children? What
would you answer if Jesus said to you, Do you love
me? Could you say to Jesus, Look into my heart,
and you will see that I love you? If you do really
love him, you will hate lies and passions, and you
will try to be kind and gentle, and to please Jesus
all the day.</p>

<p>Why did Jesus ask Peter so often whether he
loved him? Why did he ask him three times over?</p>

<p>Peter had said he did not know Jesus three times
over. So Jesus wanted to hear him say he loved
him three times over.</p>

<p>Then Jesus told Peter what would happen to
him when he was old. Jesus said to Peter, When
you were young, you walked about where you liked;
but when you are old some men will take you, and
stretch out your hands, and carry you where you do
not like to go.</p>

<p>Jesus meant that Peter would be crucified; men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
would stretch out his hands on a cross, and nail
him as they had done Jesus. Wicked people would
crucify Peter because he loved Jesus; but Peter
would never say again that he did not know Jesus.</p>

<p>Peter was not proud now as he used to be. And
Peter would pray to God to keep him from sin.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> used to come and see his disciples after he
was made alive again; but he did not live always
with them, as he once had done.</p>

<p>He told them he was soon going up to his Father.
When I am gone, you must tell people about me.
You must tell the people who crucified me, that I
will forgive them if they are sorry. The Holy
Spirit will come down from heaven, for my
Father has promised to send him down soon: Wait
at Jerusalem till he come. I will always be with
you, though you do not see me. Some day I shall
come back again.</p>

<p>The disciples asked Jesus when he would come
back; but Jesus would not tell them when.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>One day Jesus and his disciples walked together
to the top of a hill. Jesus began to pray with his
disciples, and he lifted up his hands and blessed
them. While he was doing this he was taken up to
heaven, and a cloud hid him at last from the eyes
of his disciples. They still looked up, and saw the
cloud go higher and higher till they could see it
no more. But still they went on looking. Then
they heard some persons speaking to them; they
looked to see who it was, and they saw two angels
standing by them. The angels were dressed in
white shining clothes. They said, Why do you
look so long at the sky? Jesus will come some day
again. So the disciples went back to Jerusalem, to
wait for the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think they were very unhappy, now
Jesus was gone? No, they were not. They knew
he was gone to get a place in heaven ready for
them, and that they should live with him forever;
and this made them glad.</p>

<h2>LESSON L.<br />
<small>PETER IN PRISON.<br />
<span class="smcap">Acts</span>, ii. xii. 1-23.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">What</span> had Jesus promised to send when he was
gone back to his Father?</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>And he did send the Holy Spirit, as he had promised.
Then the disciples began to speak of Jesus to
all the wicked people.</p>

<p>They said to them, You have crucified the Son
of God. He is alive, and is gone up to sit on his
Fathers throne; but he will forgive you, and give
you the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Some of the wicked people were sorry for what
they had done to Jesus, and begged God to forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
them; and some of the wicked people were
not sorry, but tried to kill the disciples.</p>

<p>A wicked king cut off the head of James with
a sword, and then shut up Peter in prison, meaning
to kill him soon.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a prison?</p>

<p>It is a dark place with great doors, and bars,
and walls all round.</p>

<p>Some soldiers took Peter, and put chains on his
hands, and chains on his feet, and they locked the
door of the prison. Men sat at the door, that no
one might get in.</p>

<p>Peters friends were very unhappy because he
was in prison; but they could not take him out.
Yet there was one thing they could do; they could
pray to God to save Peter, and so they did. Peter’s
friends sat up at night and prayed to God.</p>

<p>The wicked king said, To-morrow I shall have
Peter killed. But God would not let Peter be killed.
So God told one of his beautiful angels to go and
let Peter out of the prison. The angel could go
into the prison without opening the doors.</p>

<p>It was night when the angel came. Peter was
asleep. On each side of him there was a soldier,
and Peter was chained to them both. You would
not like to sleep in a prison with soldiers near you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and chains on your hands; but Peter knew that God
loved him, and that he was safe.</p>

<p>So the angel came. It was dark in the prison.</p>

<p>Could Peter see the angel?</p>

<p>Yes; for the angel was bright like the sun, and
made the prison light.</p>

<p>The angel touched Peter on the side, and lifted
him up, and the chains fell off Peter’s hands.</p>

<p>He told Peter to put on his clothes; and Peter
did so. Then the angel said, Follow me. So the
angel walked first, and Peter followed him. They
went through the prison; but the men at the doors
did not see Peter go out, for God made them sleep.
Peter was quite surprised; he thought he was
dreaming, and that he did not see a real angel.</p>

<p>At last Peter came to a great iron gate. It was
fast locked; but the angel took no key to open it.
It opened of itself, and let Peter and the angel go
through.</p>

<p>Now they were in the street. Still the angel
went on, and Peter came after him; but they did
not speak a word.</p>

<p>All the people were asleep, and did not know
that a bright angel was walking in the street. The
angel only walked down one street, and then he
went back to heaven, and left Peter standing alone
in the street, in the dark.</p>

<p>Peter stood some time thinking to himself, What
a wonderful thing has happened! I was shut up in
prison; but God has sent his angel to let me out.
The king meant to kill me to-morrow, but now I
shall not be killed.</p>

<p>I know that Peter thanked God for his kindness.
Peter did not stay all night in the street. He went
to the house of a good woman whom he knew, and
he knocked at the door.</p>

<p>Were the people in the house asleep?</p>

<p>No, they were all awake, though it was night.</p>

<p>Why were they not in bed?</p>

<p>This good woman had heard how the king would
kill Peter to-morrow; so she and her friends were
praying for Peter, and while they were praying they
heard a knock: it was a strange thing to hear a
knock in the night; but they never guessed who it
was.</p>

<p>A maid named Rhoda went to the door, but she
was afraid to open it, lest it should be some of the
wicked people come to kill the poor woman and
her friends; so she stopped at the door without
opening it, to hear who it was: but when she heard
Peter speak, how much pleased she was! she knew
his voice. She did not say, Are you Peter? She
was sure it was Peter. She was so much surprised
that she forgot to open the door; but ran back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
her mistress and the rest of the disciples, and said,
Peter is standing before the gate; but they said,
No, it cannot be Peter; he is shut up in prison.</p>

<p>The maid said, It is Peter; I am sure it is. While
they were talking, Peter was standing outside, and
he went on knocking, because nobody opened the
door. Soon his friends ran and opened the door,
and when they saw Peter they were quite surprised.</p>

<p>How did you get out of prison? they said.</p>

<p>Then Peter made a sign with his hand to make
them all quiet, that he might tell them how he got
out of prison.</p>

<p>God sent an angel, said Peter, who brought me
out of the prison. Go and tell all my friends what
has happened, for I must go away. So Peter went
and hid himself in a place where the wicked king
could not find him.</p>

<p>What do you think the soldiers said when they
could not find Peter in the morning?</p>

<p>They were much frightened: they saw his chains,
but not Peter. They found the gates locked; they
could not think how Peter got out of prison.</p>

<p>So the king sent for Peter. This was the day
when Peter was to be killed. All the wicked people
in Jerusalem were expecting to see him. The
king’s servants said, Where is Peter? Bring him
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The soldiers answered, We cannot tell where
Peter is: he is gone.</p>

<p>The servants went and told the king that Peter
was not in prison. The king was very angry; he
said, Bring the soldiers to me. They must have
fallen asleep.</p>

<p>When the soldiers came, they could not tell the
king how Peter had got away. For God had made
them sleep when the angel fetched Peter. The
king was in a great rage, and said, The soldiers
must be killed.</p>

<p>What a wicked king this was! He loved to do
wickedness. He was very proud, and hated God
and God’s people. He fell into passions, and only
cared to please himself. At last God sent an angel
to kill him, and worms ate up his flesh until he died.</p>

<p>God sends angels to punish the wicked, and to
help people who love him as Peter did.</p>

<h2>LESSON LI.<br />
<small>JOHN.<br />
<span class="smcap">Rev.</span> i. 9-19; iv. 1-5; xxii.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Almost</span> all the twelve disciples were killed by
wicked men at last. When Peter was old, some
wicked men crucified him, because he loved Jesus.
Now he is in heaven with Jesus, clothed in a white
robe, and all his tears wiped away. His dear Lord
Jesus is always near him, and this makes him happy.</p>

<p>John lived till he was very, very old, indeed. A
wicked king caught him, and put him into a country
far away from his friends: there was water all
round, so that he could not get away.</p>

<p>Was John unhappy there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>No; God was with him, and John loved to think
of the Father, and of his Son Jesus.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, and John was thinking of God,
when he heard a voice behind him, like the noise
of a trumpet, very loud indeed. He turned round
to see who it was; and whom do you think he saw?</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus come down from heaven, all
glorious and shining! When John saw him, he
could not speak or stand; he was afraid, and he
fell down on the ground, as if he were dead. But
Jesus touched him with his hand and said, Fear
not; I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold,
I am alive for evermore. Then Jesus took John up
into heaven, and an angel showed him most beautiful
things.</p>

<p>John saw a throne on which God sat. There was
a rainbow round the throne. There were a great
many seats, and men sitting on them, clothed in
white, with crowns of gold on their heads. The
men took off their crowns, and threw them down
before the throne and praised Jesus, the Lamb of
God.</p>

<p>John saw a great many angels, more than he
could count, standing round the throne, singing
praises to the Lamb.</p>

<p>But of all the things John saw in heaven, there
was nothing so glorious as God himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>In heaven there is no sun, nor moon, nor candle,
nor lamp. Yet it is always light, because God
shines more brightly than the sun. The music of
harps and sweet singing are always to be heard;
for all the angels can sing the praises of God.</p>

<p>John wondered at the things he saw and heard;
and he fell down at the feet of the angel who had
shown them to him.</p>

<p>But the angel said, You must not worship me;
I am only a servant of God: you must worship God.</p>

<p>Then the angel went on speaking and said, Jesus
will soon come down from heaven to judge the
world. He will open the gates of heaven to let
those people in who mind God’s word; but those
who tell lies, and do wicked things, shall be shut
out.</p>

<p>All people who love Jesus wish him to come
again in the clouds.</p>

<p>Do you wish to see Jesus, my little children?</p>

<p>Then you may answer, Even so; come, Lord
Jesus.</p>

<p>I hope that when you die your spirit will go to
Jesus, and that when Jesus comes again, he will
bring you with him.</p>

<p>John wrote down in a book the things he had
seen in heaven. All that John wrote is in the Bible.
At last John died, and his soul went to God. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
is with Jesus now in heaven. He is now playing
on a golden harp, and singing with the angels.
But when Jesus comes again in the clouds, John
will come with him.</p>

<h2>LESSON LII.<br />
<small>THE JUDGMENT DAY.<br />
I. <span class="smcap">Thess.</span> iv. 15-17. <span class="smcap">Rev.</span> xx. 11 to end.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> know that Jesus will come again in the clouds?</p>

<p>Little children, do you know when he will come?
Shall I tell you when Jesus will come? You would
like to know; but I cannot tell you when: I do not
know. The angels do not know what day it will be.
No one knows but God. There will be many wicked
people in the world then, and some good people.
An angel will blow a great trumpet, and Jesus will
say to the people who are dead, Come out of your
graves.</p>

<p>The bodies of all the dead people will come out
of their graves. Those who love Christ will be like
the angels, and will fly up into the air. If you are
alive when Jesus comes, he will catch you up in the
air to meet him.</p>

<p>As soon as you see Jesus you will be like him,
all shining and glorious. Jesus will be king over
the whole world, and make all people happy.</p>

<p>At last Jesus will sit upon a white throne, and
everybody will stand round his throne. He will
open some books, in which he has written down
all the naughty things people have done. God has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
seen all the naughty things you have done. He
can see in the dark as well as in the light, and
knows all your naughty thoughts. He will read
everything out of his books before the angels that
stand around. Yet God will forgive some people,
because Christ died upon the cross.</p>

<p>Whom will he forgive?</p>

<p>Those who love Jesus with all their hearts. He
has written down their names in another book,
called The Book of Life. He will forgive their
sins, wipe away their tears, and let them live with
him forever.</p>

<p>Do you hope that Jesus has written down your
name in his book?</p>

<p>Ask him to give you his Holy Spirit. Then you
will love Jesus, and hate to do wickedly.</p>

<p>This is what God will do to those who do not love
him—God will bind them in chains, and put them
in a lake of fire. There they will gnash their teeth,
and weep and wail forever.</p>

<p>God will put Satan in the same place, and all the
devils. Satan is the father of the wicked, and he
and his children shall be tormented forever. They
shall not have one drop of water to cool their burning
tongues. Many people in hell will say, How I
wish I had listened to the words of my teachers!
But I would not mind; and now it is too late. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
never can come out of this dreadful place. How
foolish I have been! Once God would have heard
my prayers, but now I weep and wail in vain.</p>

<p>I hope, my dear children, that none of you will
ever speak such sad words.</p>

<p>Remember Satan goes about as a cunning serpent,
trying to make you disobey God; but Christ
will keep you from wickedness, if you pray to him.</p>

<p>One day God will burn up this world we live in.
It is dreadful to see a house on fire. Did you ever
see one? But how dreadful it will be to see this
great world and all the houses and trees burning!
The noise will be terrible: the heat will be very
great. The wicked will not be able to get away.
They will be cast into the lake of fire. The world
will not burn forever; God will make another world,
much better than this.</p>

<p>If you are God’s child, you will not be frightened
when the world is burning, for you will be safe with
Jesus, praising him for having loved and saved you.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
